Captain . Yes , sir ?
Tell them we wish to board at once .
With all due respect the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor wish to board immediately .
Yes , of course .
As you know , our blockade is perfectly legal ...
and we 'd be happy to receive the ambassadors .
I 'm TC - 14 at your service . This way , please .
We are greatly honoured by your visit , Ambassadors .
Make yourselves comfortable . My master will be with you shortly .
I have a bad feeling about this .
I do n't sense anything . It 's not about the mission , Master .
It 's something elsewhere , elusive .
Do n't centre on your anxieties , Obi - Wan .
Keep your concentration here and now , where it belongs .
But Master Yoda said I should be mindful of the future .
But not at the expense of the moment .
Be mindful of the living Force , young Padawan .
Yes , Master .
How do you think this trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor 's demands ?
These Federation types are cowards .
The negotiations will be short .
What ? What did you say ?
The ambassadors are Jedi knights , I believe .
I knew it . They 're here to force a settlement .
Distract them . I will contact Lord Sidious .
Are you brain - dead ? I 'm not going in there with two Jedi .
Send a droid .
Is it in their nature to make us wait this long ?
No . I sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute .
What is it ?
This scheme of yours has failed , Lord Sidious .
The blockade is finished . We dare not go against these Jedi .
Viceroy , I do n't want this stunted slime in my sight again .
This turn of events is unfortunate . We must accelerate our plans .
Begin landing your troops .
My lord , is that legal ?
I will make it legal .
And the Jedi ?
The chancellor should never have brought them into this .
Kill them immediately .
Yes , my lord . As you wish .
Captain , look !
Shields -
Sorry .
Dioxis .
They must be dead by now . Destroy what 's left of them .
Oh ! Excuse me .
Check it out , Corporal . We 'll cover you . Roger , roger .
Uh - oh . Blast them .
What is going on down there ?
We lost the transmission , sir .
Have you ever encountered a Jedi knight before , sir ?
Well , no , but I do n't - Seal off the bridge .
Yes , sir . That wo n't be enough , sir .
I want droidekas up here at once !
We will not survive this .
Close the blast doors !
That will hold them .
They are still coming through .
This is impossible !
Where are those droidekas ?
Master ! Destroyers !
They have shield generators !
It 's a standoff . Let 's go .
They 're no match for droidekas .
They 've gone up the ventilation shaft .
Battle droids . It 's an invasion army .
This is an odd play for the Trade Federation .
We 've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum .
Let 's split up .
Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet .
You were right about one thing , Master .
The negotiations were short .
Sir , a transmission from the planet .
It 's Queen Amidala herself .
At last we are getting results .
Again you come before us , Your Highness .
You will not be so pleased when you hear what I have to say , Viceroy .
Your trade boycott of our planet has ended .
I was not aware of such failure .
I have word that the chancellor 's ambassadors are with you now ...
and that you have been commanded to reach settlement .
I know nothing of any ambassadors .
You must be mistaken .
Beware , Viceroy .
The Federation has gone too far this time .
We would never do anything without the approval of the senate .
You assume too much .
We will see .
She 's right . The senate will never - It 's too late now .
Do you think she suspects an attack ? I do n't know .
But we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there .
Negotiations have n't started because the ambassadors are n't there ?
How could that be true ?
I have assurances from the chancellor his ambassadors did arrive .
It must - handiwork - negotiate - ambassadors -
nobody would - Senator Palpatine .
What 's happening ?
Check the transmission generator .
A communications disruption can mean only one thing : invasion .
The Federation would not dare go that far .
The senate would revoke their trade franchise , and they 'd be finished .
We must continue to rely on negotiation .
Negotiation ? We 've lost all communications .
And where are the chancellor 's ambassadors ?
This is a dangerous situation , Your Highness .
Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle - hardened Federation army .
I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war .
Yes , Viceroy ? Captain , we 've searched the ship ...
They may have gotten on one of your landing craft .
If they 're down here , sir , we 'll find them .
Use caution . TheseJedi are not to be underestimated .
Oh , no ! Get away ! Get out of here !
Was 'n dat ? Hey , wait !
Oh , mooie - mooie , I love you .
You almost got us killed . Are you brainless ?
I spake .
The ability to speak does not make you intelligent .
Now , get out of here . No , no , mesa stay . Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks . Mesa your humble servant .
That wo n't be necessary . Oh , but it 'tis .
Oh , no ! Stay down !
You saved my again .
What 's this ? A local .
Let 's get out of here before more droids show up .
More ? " More " did you spake ?
Ex - squeeze - me , but de mostest safest place would be Gunga City .
Is where I grew up . ' Tis a hidden city .
A city ? Uh - huh .
Can you take us there ?
On second thought , no . Not really , no . No ?
' Tis embarrassing ...
but my afraid my 've been banished .
My forgotten . Da bosses would do terrible tings to me . Terrible tings to me if me goen back dare .
You hear that ? Yah .
That is the sound of a thousand terrible things heading this way .
If they find us , they will crush us ...
grind us into tiny pieces and blast us into oblivion .
Oh . Yousa point is well seen .
Dis way . Hurry !
How much further ? Wesa goen underwater , okeyday ?
Ah , my warning you . Gungans no liken outsiders , so do n't spect a warm welcome .
Do n't worry . This has n't been our day for warm welcomes .
Yousa follow me now , okeyday ?
So good bein home !
Hey , yousa . Stopa dare .
Heyo - dales , Cap 'n Tarpals . Mesa back .
Noah gain , Jar Jar . Yousa goen tada bosses .
Yousa in big dudu dis time .
How wude .
Yousa cannot bees hair .
Dis army of Mackineeks up dare is new weesong .
A droid army is about to attack the Naboo . We must warn them .
Wesa no like da Naboo .
Da Naboo tink day so smarty .
Day tink day brains so big .
Once those droids take control of the surface , they will take control of you .
Mesa no tink so .
Day not know of uss - en .
You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle .
What happens to one of you will affect the other . You must understand this .
Wesa no carrrre - nn about da Naboo .
Then speed us on our way .
Wesa ganna speed yous away .
We could use a transport .
Wesa give yousa una bongo .
Da speediest way tooda Naboo ...
'tis goen through the planet core .
Now go .
Thank you for your help . We leave in peace .
Master , what 's a bongo ?
A transport , I hope .
Deysa setten yousa up .
Goen through da planet core ? Bad bombin ' .
Any help here would be hot .
Master , we 're short on time .
We 'll need a navigator to get us through the planet 's core .
This Gungan may be of help .
What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here ?
Hisen to be pune - ished .
I saved his life .
He owes me what you call a " life - debt . "
Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now .
Binks ...
yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen ?
Begone wit him !
Count me outta dis one .
Better dead here than dead in da core .
Yee gods ! What mesa sayin ?
Dis is nutsen . Oh , gooberfish !
Why were you banished , Jar Jar ? It 's a longo tale - o ...
buta a small part of it would be mesa ... clumsy .
You were banished for being clumsy ? Yousa might 'n be sayin dat .
Mesa caused mabee one two - y lettle bitty axadentes , huh ?
Yud - say boom da gasser den crashin der boss 's heyblibber , den banished .
Big gooberfish ! Huge - o teeth !
There 's always a bigger fish . Mesa tink we goen back now .
The invasion is on schedule , my lord .
I have the senate bogged down in procedures .
They will have no choice but to accept your control of the system .
The queen has great faith that the senate will side with her .
Queen Amidala is young and naive .
You will find controlling her will not be difficult .
Yes , my lord .
You did n't tell him about the missing Jedi .
No need to report that to him until we have something to report .
Where wesa goin ? Do n't worry . The Force will guide us .
Oh , maxi big , da Force .
Well , dat smells stinkowiff .
We 're losing power . Oh , no !
Wesa dyin ' here .
Just relax . We 're not in trouble yet . What " yet " ?
Monsters out dare . Leak 'n in here . All sink 'n and no power ? Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble ?
Power 's back .
Relax .
You overdid it .
Head for that outcropping .
Oh , boy .
Viceroy , we have captured the queen .
Ah , victory .
Dis 'n loverly .
How will you explain this invasion to the senate ?
The queen and I will sign a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here .
I have assurances it will be ratified by the senate .
I will not cooperate . Now , now , Your Highness .
In time , your people 's suffering will persuade you to see our point of view .
Commander . Yes , sir .
Process them .
Captain , take them to Camp 4 .
Roger , roger .
We should leave the street , Your Highness .
Get their weapons .
Yousa guys bombad !
We 're ambassadors for the supreme chancellor .
Your negotiations seemed to have failed , Ambassador .
The negotiations never took place .
It 's urgent that we make contact with the Republic .
They 've knocked out all our communications .
Do you have transports ? In the main hangar . This way .
There are too many of them . That wo n't be a problem .
Your Highness , under the circumstances , I suggest you come to Coruscant with us .
Thank you , Ambassador , but my place is with my people .
They will kill you if you stay . They would n't dare .
They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion legal .
They ca n't afford to kill her .
There is something else behind all this , Your Highness .
There 's no logic in the Federation 's move here .
My feelings tell me they will destroy you .
Our only hope is for the senate to side with us .
Senator Palpatine will need your help .
Either choice presents great danger ... to us all .
We are brave , Your Highness .
If you are to leave , Your Highness , it must be now .
Then I will plead our case to the senate .
Be careful , Governor .
We 'll need to free those pilots .
I 'll deal with that .
Halt .
I 'm ambassador to the supreme chancellor . I 'm taking these people to Coruscant .
Where are you taking them ? To Coruscant .
Coruscant ? Uh , that does n't compute .
Uh , wait . Uh , you 're under arrest .
Come on . Move !
Go !
Now , stay here and keep out of trouble .
Hello , boyos .
There 's the blockade .
The shield generator 's been hit !
How wude !
We 're losing droids fast .
If we ca n't get the shield generator fixed , we 'll be sitting ducks .
The shields are gone .
The power 's back !
That little droid did it . He bypassed the main power drive .
Deflector shields up at maximum .
There 's not enough power to get us to Coruscant . The hyperdrive is leaking .
We 'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship .
Here , Master . Tatooine .
It 's small , out of the way , poor . The Trade Federation have no presence there .
How can you be sure ?
It 's controlled by the Hutts .
You ca n't take Her Royal Highness there . The Hutts are gangsters .
If they discovered her - It 'd be no different than landing ...
except that the Hutts are n't looking for her which gives us the advantage .
And Queen Amidala , has she signed the treaty ?
She has disappeared , my lord .
One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade .
I want that treaty signed .
My lord ...
it 's impossible to locate the ship . It 's out of our range .
Not for a Sith .
This is my apprentice ...
Darth Maul .
He will find your lost ship .
This is getting out of hand .
Now there are two of them .
We should not have made this bargain .
An extremely well - put - together little droid , Your Highness .
Without a doubt , it saved the ship , as well as our lives .
It is to be commended . What is its number ?
R2 - D2 , Your Highness .
Thank you , R2 - D2 .
Padmé .
Clean this droid up as best you can .
It deserves our gratitude .
Continue , Captain .
Your Highness , with your permission we 're heading for a remote planet called Tatooine .
It 's in a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation .
I do not agree with the Jedi on this .
You must trust my judgment , Your Highness .
Hello .
Sorry . Husa are yousa ?
I 'm Padmé .
Mesa Jar Jar Binks .
You 're a Gungan , are n't you ?
How 'd you end up here with us ? My no know .
Den boom ! Getten berry scared ...
and grabben dat Jedi , and pow - mesa here .
Mesa getten berry , berry scared .
That 's it - Tatooine . There 's a settlement .
Land near the outskirts . We do n't want to attract attention .
The hyperdrive generator 's gone , Master . We 'll need a new one .
That 'll complicate things . Be wary .
I sense a disturbance in the Force . I feel it also , Master .
Do n't let them send any transmissions .
The sun doen murder to mesa skin .
Wait !
Wait .
Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you .
No more commands from Her Highness today , Captain .
The spaceport is not going to be pleasant .
The queen wishes it . She 's curious about the planet .
This is not a good idea . Stay close to me .
Moisture farms , for the most part .
Some indigenous tribes and scavengers .
The few spaceports like this one are havens for those that do n't wish to be found .
Like us .
Dissen berry , berry bad .
Icky , icky goo !
We 'll try one of the smaller dealers .
I need parts for a J - type 327 Nubian .
Ah , yes ! Nubian . We have lots of that .
My droid has a readout of what I need .
So , let me take thee out back , huh ? We 'll find what you need .
Do n't touch anything .
Are you an angel ? What ?
An angel . I heard the deep space pilots talk about them .
They 're the most beautiful creatures in the universe .
They live on the moons of lego , I think .
You 're a funny little boy . How do you know so much ?
I listen to all the traders and star pilots who come through here .
I 'm a pilot , you know , and someday I 'm gonna fly away from this place .
You 're a pilot ? Mm - hmm . All my life .
How long have you been here ?
Since I was very little . Three , I think .
My mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt ...
but she lost us betting on the Podraces .
You 're a slave ?
I 'm a person , and my name is Anakin . I 'm sorry .
I do n't fully understand . This is a strange place to me .
I got ya . Hey ! Hit the nose .
A T - 14 hyperdrive generator . Thee in luck .
I 'm the only one hereabouts who has one .
But thee might as well buy a new ship . It would be cheaper , I think , huh .
Saying of which how 's thee gonna pay for all this , huh ?
I have 20 , 000 Republic dataries .
Republic credits ?
Republic credits are no good out here . I need something more real .
I do n't have anything else , but credits will do fine .
No , they wo n't . Credits will do fine .
No , they wo n't !
What , you think you 're some kind of Jedi , waving your hand around like that ?
I 'm a Toydarian . Mind tricks do n't work on me . Only money .
No money , no parts , no deal .
And no one else has a T - 14 hyperdrive , I promise you that .
Would n't have lasted long anyways if I was n't so good at building things .
We 're leaving . Jar Jar .
I 'm glad to have met you , Anakin .
I was glad to meet you too .
Yippee !
A few containers of supplies .
The queen 's wardrobe , maybe , but not enough for you to barter with ...
not in the amount you 're talking about .
All right . I 'm sure another solution will present itself .
I 'll check back later .
Noah gain . Noah gain .
Da beings hereabouts , cawazy !
Wesa be wobbed un crunched .
Not likely . We have nothing of value . That 's our problem .
Are you going to pay for that ?
It costs seven wupiupi .
Who , mesa -
Hi . Hi there .
He picked a fight with a Dug ...
an especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba .
Mesa haten crunchen . Das da las ting mesa want .
Nevertheless , the boy is right . You were heading into trouble .
Thanks , my young friend .
But mesa doen nutten !
This storm will slow them down .
Looks pretty bad .
Panaka . Receiving a message from home .
We 'll be right there .
Here , you 'll like these pallies .
Here . Thank you .
My bones are aching .
Storm 's coming up , Ani . You better get home quick .
Do you have shelter ? We 'll head back to our ship .
Is it far ? It 's on the outskirts .
You 'll never reach the outskirts in time .
Sandstorms are very , very dangerous .
Come on . I 'll take you to my place .
Mom ! Mom , I 'm home ! Ah , dissen cosy .
These are my friends , Mom . Hello .
I 'm Qui - Gon Jinn . I 'm building a droid . You wanna see ?
Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter .
Come on . I 'll show you 3PO .
Is n't he great ? He 's not finished yet .
He 's wonderful .
You really like him ?
He 's a protocol droid to help Mom . Watch .
Where is everybody ?
Oh , hello . I am C - 3PO , human cyborg relations .
How might I serve you ?
He 's perfect . Oh . Perfect .
When the storm is over , I 'll show you my racer . I 'm building a Podracer .
I 'm not sure this floor is entirely stable .
Hello . I do n't believe we have been introduced .
R2 - D2 . A pleasure to meet you .
I am C - 3PO , human cyborg relations .
I beg your pardon , but what do you mean , " naked " ?
My parts are showing ? My goodness !
The death toll is catastrophic . We must bow to their wishes .
You must contact me .
It 's a trick . Send no reply . Send no transmissions of any kind .
It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace .
What if it is true , and the people are dying ?
Either way , we 're running out of time .
Tatooine is sparsely populated .
If the trace was correct , I will find them quickly , Master .
Move against the Jedi first .
You will then have no difficulty in taking the queen to Naboo to sign the treaty .
At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi .
At last we will have revenge .
You have been well - trained , my young apprentice .
They will be no match for you .
All slaves have a transmitter placed inside their bodies somewhere .
I 've been working on a scanner to try and locate mine .
Any attempt to escape - And they blow you up !
How wude !
I ca n't believe there 's still slavery in the galaxy .
The Republic 's antislavery laws -
The Republic does n't exist out here .
We must survive on our own .
Xcuse me .
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace ?
They have Podracing on Malastare .
Very fast , very dangerous .
I 'm the only human who can do it .
You must have Jedi reflexes if you race pods .
Do n't do that again .
You 're a Jedi knight , are n't you ?
What makes you think that ? I saw your laser sword .
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon .
Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him .
I do n't think so . No one can kill a Jedi .
I wish that were so .
I had a dream I was a Jedi .
I came back here and freed all the slaves .
Have you come to free us ? No , I 'm afraid not .
I think you have . Why else would you be here ?
I can see there 's no fooling you , Anakin .
We 're on our way to Coruscant , the central system in the Republic ...
on a very important mission .
How did you end up out here in the outer rim ?
Our ship was damaged , and we 're stranded here until we can repair it .
I can help . I can fix anything .
I believe you can .
But first we must acquire the parts we need .
Wit no - nutten mula to trade .
These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind .
Gambling . Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races .
Podracing .
Greed can be a powerful ally .
I built a racer . It 's the fastest ever .
There 's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve .
You could enter my pod .
Anakin , Watto wo n't let you . Watto does n't know I 've built it .
You could make him think it was yours and get him to let me pilot it for you .
I do n't want you to race . It 's awful . I die every time Watto makes you do it .
But , Mom , I love it .
The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need .
Anakin .
Your mother 's right .
No .
Mom , you say the biggest problem in this universe is nobody helps each other .
I 'm sure Qui - Gon does n't want to put your son in danger .
We 'll find some other way .
There is no other way .
I may not like it , but he can help you .
He was meant to help you .
Are you sure about this ?
Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know ?
The queen will not approve .
The queen does n't need to know .
Well , I do n't approve .
The boy tells me you want to sponsor him in the race .
How can you do this ?
Not on the Republic credits , I think .
My ship will be the entry fee .
Not bad ! Not bad , huh ? Nubian , huh ?
It 's in good order , except for the parts I need .
What would the boy ride ?
He smashed up my pod in the last race . It would take some long time to fix it .
It was n't my fault . Really .
Sebulba flashed me with his vents .
I actually saved the pod , mostly .
That you did .
The boy 's good . No doubts there , huh ?
I have acquired a pod in a game of chance . The fastest ever built .
I hope you did n't kill anyone I know for it , huh ?
So , you supply the pod and the entry fee ...
and I supply the boy . We split the winnings 50 - 50 , I think , huh ?
If it 's going to be 50 - 50 I suggest you front the cash for the entry .
If we win ...
you keep all the winnings , minus the cost of the parts I need .
And if we lose , you keep my ship .
Either way , you win .
Deal !
What if this plan fails , Master ?
We could be stuck here a very long time .
Well , it 's too dangerous to call for help ...
and a ship without a power supply is n't going to get us anywhere .
there 's something about this boy .
You should be very proud of your son .
He gives without any thought of reward .
He knows nothing of greed . He has -
He has special powers .
Yes .
He can see things before they happen .
That 's why he appears to have such quick reflexes .
It 's a Jedi trait .
He deserves better than a slave 's life .
Had he been born in the Republic , we would have identified him early .
The Force is unusually strong with him . That much is clear .
Who was his father ?
There was no father .
I carried him , I gave birth , I raised him .
I ca n't explain what happened .
Can you help him ?
I do n't know .
I did n't actually come here to free slaves .
Wow , a real astro droid !
How do you get so lucky ? That is n't the half of it .
I 'm in the Boonta race tomorrow . What ?
With this ?
You 're such a joker , Ani .
You 've been working on that for years . It 's never gonna run .
Come on . Let 's go and play ball .
Keep racing , Ani . You 're gonna be bug squash .
Keep away from those energy binders .
If your hand gets caught in the beam , it 's gonna go numb for hours .
Okay .
My tongue is fat .
My tongue - Wrench . Where is de wrench ? Oh , dare it is .
I 'm stuck .
You know , I find that Jar Jar creature to be a little odd .
You do n't even know if this thing 's gonna run .
It will . I think it 's time we found out .
Here , use this power charge . Yes , sir ! Come on , Kitster . Let 's move away .
My mouth .
Ani , I 'm stuck .
My tongue is fat .
You 're quite right . He 's very odd indeed .
Thank you .
It 's working ! It 's working !
Stay still , Ani . Let me clean this cut .
There 's so many . Do they all have a system of planets ?
Most of them .
Has anyone been to ' em all ?
Not likely .
I wanna be the first one to see ' em all .
Ani , bedtime !
There we are . Good as new .
Ani , I 'm not gonna tell you again .
What are you doing ? Checking your blood for infections .
Go on . You have a big day tomorrow .
Sleep well , Ani .
Obi - Wan ? Yes , Master ?
I need an analysis of this blood sample I 'm sending you .
Wait a minute .
I need a midi - chlorian count .
The reading is off the chart . Over 20 , 000 .
Even Master Yoda does n't have a midi - chlorian count that high .
No Jedi has .
What does that mean ?
I 'm not sure .
I wanna see your spaceship the moment the race is over .
Patience , my blue friend .
You 'll have your winnings before the suns set . And we 'll be far away from here .
Not if your ship belongs to me , I think , huh ?
I warn you , no funny business .
You do n't think Anakin can win ? Do n't get me wrongo .
I have great faith in the boy .
He 's a credit to your race ...
but Sebulba there is going to win , I think .
Oh , no !
Why do you think that ?
He always wins !
I am betting heavily on Sebulba .
I 'll take that bet . What ?
I 'll wager my new racing pod against , say ...
the boy and his mother .
No pod is worth two slaves , not by a long shot .
The boy , then .
We 'll let fate decide , huh ?
I just happen to have a chance cube here .
Blue , it 's the boy . Red ...
his mother .
You won this small toss , outlander ...
but you wo n't win the race !
So it makes little difference !
What 'd he mean by that ? I 'll tell you later .
Oh , my . Space travel sounds rather perilous .
I can assure you , they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships .
This is so wizard , Ani . I 'm sure you 'll do it this time . Do what ?
Finish the race , of course .
You 've never won a race ?
Well , not exactly .
Not even finished ?
Kitster 's right . I will this time .
Of course you will .
That 's absolutely right . And a big turnout here from all corners of the outer rim territories .
I see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid .
I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund System .
Two - time winner Boles Roor .
Sebulba !
And in the front row , nearside pole position ...
Mawhonic !
A hearty hello ...
to Clegg Holdfast and his Voltec KT9 Wasp !
And back again , it 's the mighty Dud Bolt ...
with that incredible racing machine , the Vulptereen 327 .
And hoping for a big win today Ody Mandrell , with his record - setting pit droid team .
And a late entry , young Anakin Skywalker a local boy .
I see the flags are moving out onto the track .
Be safe .
I will , Mom . I promise .
You all set , Ani ? Yep .
Remember , concentrate on the moment .
Feel , do n't think . Use your instincts .
I will .
May the Force be with you .
Jabba the Hutt .
Welcome .
Begin the race !
Hey , looks like they 're clearing the grid .
Is he nervous ? He 's fine .
You Jedi are far too reckless . The queen is not -
The queen trusts my judgment , young handmaiden .
You should too .
Start your engines .
Oh , dissen gonna be messy . Me no watch 'n !
Oh , no !
Wait . Little Skywalker has stalled .
It looks like Quadinaros is having engine trouble also .
Come on , Ani !
And there goes Skywalker !
Go , Ani , go !
He will be hard - pressed to catch up with the leaders .
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders are camped out on the canyon dune turn .
There goes Quadinaros ' power coupling .
Where is Master Anakin ?
Look . Here he comes .
It looks like Skywalker is moving up in the field .
He has to complete two more circuits ? Oh , dear .
Skywalker 's spinning out of control !
I do n't care what universe you 're from . That 's gotta hurt !
Here he comes !
At the start of the third and final lap , Sebulba 's in the lead ...
followed closely by Skywalker !
Skywalker 's been forced onto the service ramp !
It 's Skywalker !
Amazing ! A quick control thrust , and he 's back on course !
Did he crash - ed ?
Skywalker 's in trouble ! Sebulba takes the lead !
He 's catching Sebulba !
Careful , Ani . Careful , Ani !
That little human being is out of his mind !
They 're side by side !
I ca n't believe it .
The crowds are going nuts !
Mom , I did it ! Yay !
Good going , Ani !
We owe you everything , Ani .
It 's so wonderful , Ani .
You have brought hope to those who have none .
I 'm so very proud of you .
You !
You swindled me .
You knew the boy was going to win . Somehow you knew it .
I lost everything .
Whenever you gamble , my friend , eventually you lose .
Bring the parts to the main hangar .
I 'll come by your shop later on so you can release the boy .
You ca n't have him . It was n't a fair bet .
Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts ?
I 'm sure they can settle this .
Take him .
Well , we have all the essential parts we need . I 'm going back .
Some unfinished business . I wo n't be long .
Why do I sense we 've picked up another pathetic life - form ?
It 's the boy who 's responsible for getting us these parts .
Get this hyperdrive generator installed .
Yes , Master . That should n't take long .
Come on . Hup !
Hey . These are yours .
Mom , we sold the pod ! Look at all the money we have !
My goodness ! But that 's so wonderful , Ani .
And he has been freed . What ?
You 're no longer a slave .
Did you hear that ?
Now you can make your dreams come true , Ani .
You are free .
Will you take him with you ?
Is he to become a Jedi ?
Yes . Our meeting was not a coincidence .
Nothing happens by accident .
You mean I get to come with you in your starship ?
Anakin ...
training to become a Jedi is not an easy challenge ...
and even if you succeed , it 's a hard life .
But I wanna go . It 's what I 've always dreamed of doing .
Can I go , Mom ?
Anakin ...
this path has been placed before you . The choice is yours alone .
I wanna do it .
Then pack your things . We have n't much time .
What about Mom ?
Is she free too ?
I tried to free your mother , Ani , but Watto would n't have it .
You 're coming with us , are n't you , Mom ?
Son , my place is here . My future is here .
It is time for you to let go .
I do n't want things to change .
But you ca n't stop the change ...
any more than you can stop the suns from setting .
I love you .
Now hurry .
Thank you .
I 'll watch after him . You have my word .
Will you be all right ?
Hello , Master Anakin .
Well , 3PO , I 've been freed and I 'm going away in a starship .
Master Anakin , you are my maker and I wish you well .
However , I should prefer it if I were a little more completed .
I 'm sorry I was n't able to finish you , 3PO ...
give you coverings and all .
I 'm gonna miss working on you . You 've been a great pal .
I 'll make sure Mom does n't sell you or anything .
Sell me ?
Bye .
Oh , my .
I ca n't do it , Mom . I just ca n't do it .
Will I ever see you again ?
What does your heart tell you ?
I hope so .
Yes . I guess .
Then we will see each other again .
I will come back and free you , Mom . I promise .
Now , be brave ...
and do n't look back .
Do n't look back .
Qui - Gon , sir , wait ! I 'm tired ! Anakin ! Drop !
Go !
Tell them to take off !
Qui - Gon 's in trouble .
Take off .
Over there . Fly low .
Are you all right ? I think so .
What was it ?
I 'm not sure ...
but it was well - trained in the Jedi arts .
My guess is it was after the queen .
What are we gonna do about it ?
We shall be patient .
Anakin Skywalker ...
meet Obi - Wan Kenobi .
You 're a Jedi too ? Pleased to meet you .
Your queen is lost , your people are starving ...
and you , Governor , are going to die much sooner than your people , I 'm afraid .
This invasion will gain you nothing .
We 're a democracy . The people have decided .
Take him away .
My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these rumoured underwater villages .
They will not stay hidden for long .
The death toll is catastrophic .
We must bow to their wishes . You must contact me .
You all right ?
It 's very cold .
You come from a warm planet , Ani .
A little too warm for my taste .
Space is cold .
The queen is worried .
Her people are suffering , dying .
She must convince the senate to intervene or ...
I 'm not sure what 'll happen .
I made this for you ...
so you 'd remember me .
I carved it out of a japor snippet .
It 'll bring you good fortune .
But I do n't need this to remember you by .
Many things will change when we reach the capital , Ani ...
but my caring for you will remain .
I care for you , too , only I -
Miss your mother .
Coruscant . The entire planet is one big city .
There 's Chancellor Valorum 's shuttle .
And look over there . Senator Palpatine is waiting for us .
It is a great gift to see you alive , Your Majesty .
With the communications breakdown , we 've been very concerned .
I 'm anxious to hear your report on the situation .
May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum .
Welcome , Your Highness .
It 's an honour to finally meet you in person .
Thank you , Supreme Chancellor .
I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the current situation .
I 've called for a special session of the senate to hear your position .
I 'm grateful for your concern , Chancellor .
There is a question of procedure but I 'm confident we can overcome it .
I must speak with the Jedi Council immediately .
The situation has become much more complicated .
Ani , come on .
Da queen 's a bein grossly nice , mesa tinks .
Pitty hot .
There is no civility , only politics .
The Republic is not what it once was .
The senate is full of greedy , squabbling delegates .
There is no interest in the common good .
I must be frank , Your Majesty . There is little chance the senate will act on the invasion .
Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope .
If I may say so , Your Majesty ...
the chancellor has little real power .
He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption .
The bureaucrats are in charge now . What options have we ?
Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger supreme chancellor ...
one who could control the bureaucrats ...
and give us justice .
You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum .
He has been our strongest supporter .
Our only other choice would be to submit a plea to the courts .
The courts take even longer to decide things than the senate .
Our people are dying , Senator .
We must do something quickly to stop the Federation .
To be realistic , Your Majesty ...
I think we 're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being .
That is something I cannot do .
He was trained in the Jedi arts .
My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith lord .
Impossible .
The Sith have been extinct for a millennium .
I do not believe the Sith could have returned without us knowing .
Hard to see , the dark side is .
We will use all our resources to unravel this mystery .
We will discover the identity of your attacker .
May the Force be with you .
Master Qui - Gon .
More to say have you ?
With your permission , my master ...
I have encountered a vergence in the Force .
A vergence , you say .
Located around a person ?
A boy .
His cells have the highest concentration of midi - chlorians I have seen in a life - form .
It is possible he was conceived by the midi - chlorians .
You refer to the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the Force .
You believe it 's this boy ?
I do n't presume to - But you do .
Revealed your opinion is .
I request the boy be tested , Master .
Trained as a Jedi you request for him , hmm ?
Finding him was the will of the Force . I have no doubt of that .
Bring him before us , then .
The boy 's here to see Padmé . Let him in .
I 'm sorry , Ani , but Padmé 's not here right now .
Who is it ?
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé , Your Highness .
I 've sent Padmé on an errand .
I 'm on my way to the Jedi temple ...
to start my training , I hope .
I may never see her again , so I came to say goodbye .
We will tell her for you . We are sure her heart goes with you .
Thank you , Your Highness .
The chair recognizes the senator from the sovereign system of Naboo .
Supreme Chancellor , delegates of the senate ...
a tragedy has occurred ...
which started right here with the taxation of trade routes ...
and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppression of the Trade Federation .
This is outrageous ! I object to the senator 's statements .
The chair does not recognize the senator from the Trade Federation at this time .
To state our allegations , I present Queen Amidala ...
recently elected ruler of the Naboo who speaks on our behalf .
Honourable representatives of the Republic ...
I come to you under the gravest of circumstances .
The Naboo system has been invaded by the droid armies of the Trade -
I object ! There is no proof !
This is incredible .
We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth .
The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honourable delegate from the Trade Federation .
A commission must be appointed .
The point - Excuse me , Chancellor .
Enter the bureaucrat . The true rulers of the Republic .
And on the payroll of the Trade Federation , I might add .
This is where Chancellor Valorum 's strength will disappear .
The point is conceded .
Will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations ?
I will not defer .
I 've come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now .
I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die ...
while you discuss this invasion in a committee .
If this body is not capable of action ...
I suggest new leadership is needed .
I move for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum 's leadership .
Order !
Now they will elect a new chancellor ...
a strong chancellor ...
one who will not let our tragedy continue .
The boy will not pass the council 's test , Master . He 's too old .
Anakin will become a Jedi , I promise you .
Do not defy the council , Master , not again .
I shall do what I must , Obi - Wan .
If you would just follow the code , you would be on the council .
They will not go along with you this time .
You still have much to learn , my young apprentice .
A ship .
A cup .
A speeder .
How feel you ?
Cold , sir .
Afraid are you ? No , sir .
See through you we can .
Be mindful of your feelings .
Your thoughts dwell on your mother .
I miss her .
Afraid to lose her , I think , mmm ?
What has that got to do with anything ?
Everything .
Fear is the path to the dark side .
Fear leads to anger . Anger leads to hate .
Hate leads to suffering .
I sense much fear in you .
Yousa tinking yousa people ganna die ?
I do n't know .
Gungans get pasted too , eh ?
I hope not .
Gungans no die 'n without a fight . Wesa warriors .
Wesa got a grand army .
Dat 's why you no liken us , mesa tinks .
Your Highness ?
Your Highness ...
Senator Palpatine has been nominated to succeed Valorum as supreme chancellor .
A surprise , to be sure , but a welcome one .
Your Majesty , if I am elected , I promise to put an end to corruption .
Who else has been nominated ?
Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of Malastare .
I feel confident our situation will create a strong sympathy vote for us .
I will be chancellor .
I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats , Senator ...
there 'll be nothing left of our people , our way of life .
I understand your concern , Your Majesty .
Unfortunately , the Federation has possession of our planet .
Senator , this is your arena .
I feel I must return to mine .
I 've decided to go back to Naboo .
Go back ?
But , Your Majesty , be realistic . They 'll force you to sign the treaty .
I will sign no treaty , Senator .
My fate will be no different than that of our people .
Captain . Your Highness .
Ready my ship . Please , Your Majesty .
It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions .
I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the senate .
The Force is strong with him .
He is to be trained , then ?
No , he will not be trained .
No ?
He is too old .
He is the chosen one . You must see it .
Clouded this boy 's future is .
I will train him , then .
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner .
An apprentice you have , Qui - Gon . Impossible to take on a second .
The code forbids it .
Obi - Wan is ready . I am ready to face the trials .
Our own counsel we will keep on who is ready .
He is headstrong and he has much to learn of the living Force but he is capable .
There is little more he can learn from me .
Young Skywalker 's fate will be decided later .
Now is not the time for this .
The senate is voting for a new supreme chancellor ...
and Queen Amidala is returning home ...
which puts pressure on the Federation and could widen the confrontation .
And draw out the queen 's attacker .
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover the identity of this dark warrior .
This is the clue we need to unravel the mystery of the Sith .
May the Force be with you .
It 's not disrespect , Master . It 's the truth .
From your point of view .
The boy is dangerous . They all sense it . Why ca n't you ?
His fate is uncertain . He 's not dangerous .
The council will decide Anakin 's future .
That should be enough for you . Now get on board .
Qui - Gon , sir , I do n't want to be a problem .
You wo n't be , Ani .
I 'm not allowed to train you ...
so I want you to watch me and be mindful .
Always remember :
Your focus determines your reality .
Stay close to me and you 'll be safe .
Master , sir ...
I heard Yoda talking about midi - chlorians .
I 've been wondering - What are midi - chlorians ?
Midi - chlorians are a microscopic life - form that resides within all living cells .
They live inside me ? Inside your cells , yes .
And we are symbionts with them . Symbionts ?
Life - forms living together for mutual advantage .
Without the midi - chlorians , life could not exist ...
and we would have no knowledge of the Force .
They continually speak to us telling us the will of the Force .
When you learn to quiet your mind you 'll hear them speaking to you .
I do n't understand .
With time and training , Ani , you will . You will .
Your Majesty , it is our pleasure to continue to serve and protect you .
I welcome your help .
Senator Palpatine fears that the Federation means to destroy me .
I assure you I will not allow that to happen .
Wesa goin ' home !
Come on , R2 .
Is the planet secure ?
We have taken over the last pockets of primitive life - forms .
We are in complete control of the planet now .
Good . I will see to it that in the senate things stay as they are .
I am sending my apprentice , Darth Maul , to join you .
Yes , my lord .
A Sith here ?
Those are the forward stabilizers .
And those two control the pitch ?
You catch on pretty quick .
As soon as we land the Federation will arrest you and force you to sign the treaty .
I agree .
I 'm not sure what you wish to accomplish by this .
I will take back what 's ours .
There are too few of us , Your Highness . We have no army .
And I can only protect you . I ca n't fight a war for you .
Jar Jar Binks .
Mesa , Your Highness ?
Yes . I need your help .
I have one battleship on my scope .
It 's a droid control ship .
They 've probably spotted us .
We have n't much time .
Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city , Master .
Good .
Do you think the queen 's idea will work ?
The Gungans will not be easily swayed .
And we cannot use our power to help her .
I 'm sorry for my behaviour , Master .
It 's not my place to disagree with you about the boy .
And I am grateful you think I 'm ready to take the trials .
You 've been a good apprentice , Obi - Wan .
And you 're a much wiser man than I am .
I foresee you will become a great Jedi knight .
Desa nobody dare !
The Gungan city is deserted !
Some kinda fight , mesa tinks .
Do you think they have been taken to the camps ?
More likely they were wiped out .
Mesa no tink so . Do you know where they are , Jar Jar ?
When in trouble , Gungans go to sacred place .
Mesa show you . Come on . Mesa show you !
Your Honour , Queen Amidala of the Naboo .
Heyo dadee Big Boss Nass , Your Honour .
Jar Jar Binks .
Who 's da uss - en uthers ?
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo .
I come before you in peace .
Ah , Naboo biggen .
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks .
Yousa all bombad .
We have searched you out because we wish to form an alliance .
Your Honour .
Whosa dis ?
I am Queen Amidala .
This is my decoy my protection , my loyal bodyguard .
I 'm sorry for my deception , but it was necessary to protect myself .
Although we do not always agree , Your Honour ...
our two great societies have always lived in peace .
The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build .
If we do not act quickly , all will be lost forever .
I ask you to help us .
No , I beg you to help us .
We are your humble servants .
Our fate is in your hands .
Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans ?
Mesa lika dis !
Maybe wesa ...
being friends .
We 've sent our patrols .
We already located their starship in the swamp .
It wo n't be long , my lord .
This is an unexpected move for her .
It 's too aggressive .
Lord Maul , be mindful .
Let them make the first move .
Yes , my master .
Deysa comin !
All right !
They 're here !
Good . They made it .
Yousa doen grand .
Jar Jar bring uss - en and da Naboo together .
So , wesa make you ...
General ?
Your Highness . What is the situation ?
Almost everyone 's in camps .
A few hundred police and guards formed an underground resistance movement .
I brought back as many of the leaders as I could .
The Federation army 's also much larger than we thought and much stronger .
Your Highness , this is a battle I do not think that we can win .
The battle is a diversion .
The Gungans must draw the droid army away from the cities .
R2 .
We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side .
Once we get to the main entrance Captain Panaka will create a diversion .
Then we can enter the palace and capture the viceroy .
Without the viceroy , they will be lost and confused .
What do you think , Master Jedi ?
The viceroy will be well - guarded .
The difficulty is getting into the throne room .
Once we 're inside , we should n't have a problem .
There is a possibility , with this diversion , many Gungans will be killed .
Wesa ready to do our - san part .
We have a plan which should immobilize the droid army .
We will send what pilots we have to knock out the droid control ship orbiting the planet .
A well - conceived plan . However , there 's great risk .
The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields .
There 's an even bigger danger .
If the viceroy escapes , Your Highness he will return with another droid army .
Well , that is why we must not fail to get the viceroy .
Everything depends on it .
She is more foolish than I thought .
We are sending all troops to meet this army assembling near the swamp .
It appears to be made up of primitives .
This will work to our advantage .
I have your approval to proceed , then , my lord ?
Wipe them out .
All of them .
Halt !
Starting up the shield .
Open fire .
Once we get inside , you find a safe place to hide and stay there .
Sure . Stay there .
I thought the battle was going to take place far from here .
This is too close .
Ani , find cover .
Quick ! Get to your ships !
Fighters straight ahead .
Roger , Bravo Leader .
Roger , Bravo Leader .
Cease fire .
Steady . Steady .
Activate the droids . Yes , sir .
Ouch time .
Fire !
My guess is the viceroy 's in the throne room .
Red group ! Blue group !
Everybody , this way !
Hey , wait for me !
Anakin , stay where you are . You 'll be safe there .
But I - Stay in that cockpit .
We 'll handle this . We 'll take the long way .
We gotta do something , R2 .
I 'm trying to ! I do n't know where the trigger is !
Oops , wrong one . Maybe it 's this one .
Nope . Wait . Here it is .
Let 's go !
It 's on automatic pilot .
Try to override it .
We do n't have time for this , Captain .
Look , there they are .
That 's where the autopilot 's taking us .
Dumb droid . Take that !
Get off ! Get off ! Get off !
The deflector shield is too strong .
This is tense !
R2 , get us off this autopilot . It 's gonna get us both killed .
You did it , R2 !
Let 's go left .
Go back ?
Qui - Gon told me to stay in this cockpit , so that 's what I 'm gonna do .
I 'll try spinning . That 's a good trick .
I know we 're in trouble . Just hang on .
Go !
Ascension guns !
Retreat ! Retreat !
Dis is nutsen .
Uh - oh . Big boomers .
Give me a lift !
Jar Jar , usen da booma !
What ? Mesa no have a booma !
Here . Taken dis one .
Jar Jar !
Jump , Jar Jar , jump !
Put down your weapons . They win this round .
We 're hit , R2 !
I 'm trying to stop ! I 'm trying to stop !
Everything 's overheated .
Oops . This is not good .
No giben up , General Jar Jar .
Mesa think of something .
Hands up .
My give up . My give up .
Your little insurrection is at an end , Your Highness .
Time for you to sign the treaty and end this pointless debate in the senate .
Viceroy !
Your occupation here has ended .
After her . This one 's a decoy .
Captain !
Jam the doors .
Now , Viceroy , we will discuss a new treaty .
Yes ! We have power . Shields up .
Take this !
And this !
Oops . We 're losing power . There seems to be a problem with the main reactor .
Impossible !
Nothing can get through our shield .
Let 's get outta here .
What 's that ? It 's blowing up from the inside !
We did n't hit it .
Now , this is Podracing .
Look , one of ours , out of the main hold !
What the -
Was 'n they doing ?
The control ship has been destroyed . Look !
They all broke - ed .
No , it 's too late .
No . Obi - Wan .
Promise -
Promise me you will train the boy .
Yes , Master .
He is the chosen one .
He will bring balance .
Train him .
Now , Viceroy ...
you 're going to have to go back to the senate and explain all this .
I think you can kiss your trade franchise goodbye .
We are indebted to you for your bravery , Obi - Wan Kenobi .
And you , young Skywalker .
We will watch your career with great interest .
Congratulations on your election , Chancellor .
Your boldness has saved our people , Your Majesty .
It 's you who should be congratulated .
Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the Republic .
Confer on you the level of Jedi knight the council does .
But agree with your taking this boy as your Padawan learner ...
I do not .
Qui - Gon believed in him .
The chosen one the boy may be .
Nevertheless grave danger I fear in his training .
Master Yoda , I gave Qui - Gon my word .
I will train Anakin .
Without the approval of the council , if I must .
Qui - Gon 's defiance I sense in you . Need that you do not .
Agree with you the council does .
Your apprentice Skywalker will be .
What will happen to me now ?
The council have granted me permission to train you .
You will be a Jedi , I promise .
There 's no doubt the mysterious warrior was a Sith .
Always two there are .
No more , no less .
A master and an apprentice .
But which was destroyed ? The master or the apprentice ?
Peace !
Senator , we 're making our final approach into Coruscant .
Very good , Lieutenant .
We made it .
I guess I was wrong .
There was no danger at all .
Cordé .
Milady , I 'm so sorry .
I 've failed you , Senator .
No .
Milady , you 're still in danger here .
I should n't have come back . This vote is very important .
You did your duty . Cordé did hers . Now , come .
Senator Amidala , please .
I do n't know how much longer I can hold off the vote , my friends .
More and more star systems are joining the separatists .
If they do break away --
I will not let this Republic that has stood for a thousand years ...
My negotiations will not fail .
If they do , you must realize ...
there are n't enough Jedi to protect the Republic .
We 're keepers of the peace , not soldiers .
Master Yoda ...
do you think it will really come to war ?
The dark side clouds everything .
Impossible to see the future is .
The Loyalist Committee has arrived , Your Honour .
Good .
Send them in .
We will discuss this matter later .
Senator Amidala , your tragedy on the landing platform --
terrible . Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart .
Do you have any idea who was behind this attack ?
Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of Naboo .
I think that Count Dooku was behind it .
He is a political idealist , not a murderer .
You know , milady , Count Dooku was once a Jedi .
He could n't assassinate anyone . It 's not in his character .
But for certain , Senator ...
in grave danger you are .
Master Jedi , may I suggest ...
the senator be placed under the protection of your graces ?
Do you really think that 's a wise decision under these stressful times ?
Chancellor , if I may comment , I do not believe --
The situation is that serious ?
No , but I do , Senator .
I realize all too well that additional security ...
might be disruptive for you ...
but perhaps someone you 're familiar with .
An old friend , like Master Kenobi .
That 's possible .
He 's just returned from a border dispute on Ansion .
Do it for me , milady . Please ?
The thought of losing you ...
is unbearable .
I will have Obi - Wan report to you immediately , milady .
Thank you , Master Windu .
You seem a little on edge . Not at all .
I have n't felt you this tense since we fell into that nest of gundarks .
You fell into that nightmare , Master ...
and I rescued you , remember ?
Oh ... yes .
You 're sweating . Relax . Take a deep breath .
I have n't seen her in ten years , Master .
Obi ? Obi ! Mesa so smilen to seein yousa ! Good to see you again , Jar Jar .
Senator Padmé .
Mesa palos here ! Lookie , lookie , Senator .
Desa Jedi arriven .
It 's a great pleasure to see you again , milady .
It has been far too long , Master Kenobi .
Ani ?
My goodness , you 've grown . So have you .
Grown more beautiful , I mean .
Well , for a senator , I mean .
Ani , you 'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine .
Our presence here will be invisible , milady , I can assure you .
I 'm Captain Typho of Her Majesty 's security service .
Queen Jamillia has been informed of your assignment .
I am grateful you are here , Master Kenobi .
The situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit .
I do n't need more security . I need answers .
I want to know who 's trying to kill me .
We are here to protect you , Senator , not to start an investigation .
We will find out who 's trying to kill you , Padmé . I promise you .
We will not exceed our mandate , my young Padawan learner .
I meant that in the interest of protecting her , Master , of course .
We will not go through this exercise again , Anakin ...
and you will pay attention to my lead .
Why ? What ?
Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer ?
Protection is a job for local security , not Jedi .
It 's overkill , Master . Investigation is implied in our mandate .
We will do exactly as the council has instructed .
And you will learn your place , young one .
Perhaps with merely your presence the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed .
Now , if you 'll excuse me I will retire .
I know I 'll feel better having you here .
I 'll have an officer stationed on every floor ...
and I 'll be in the control centre downstairs .
Mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again , Ani .
She hardly even recognized me , Jar Jar .
I 've thought about her every day since we parted and ...
she 's forgotten me completely .
Shesa happy . Happier den mesa seein her in a longo time .
You 're focusing on the negative , Anakin . Be mindful of your thoughts .
She was pleased to see us .
Now , let 's check the security .
I hit the ship , but they used a decoy .
We 'll have to try something more subtle this time , Zam .
My client is getting impatient .
Take these . Be careful . They 're very poisonous .
And , Zam , there can be no mistakes this time .
Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs .
No assassin would try that way .
Any activity up here ? Quiet as a tomb .
I do n't like just waiting here for something to happen to her .
What 's going on ? She covered the cameras .
What is she thinking ?
She programmed R2 to warn us if there is an intruder .
There are many other ways to kill a senator .
I know , but we also want to catch this assassin , do n't we , Master ?
You 're using her as bait .
It was her idea .
Do n't worry . No harm will come to her .
I can sense everything going on in that room .
Trust me .
It 's too risky .
Besides , your senses are n't that attuned , my young apprentice .
And yours are ?
Possibly .
You look tired .
I do n't sleep well any more .
Because of your mother ?
I do n't know why I keep dreaming about her .
Dreams pass in time .
I 'd much rather dream about Padmé .
Just being around her again is ... intoxicating .
Be mindful of your thoughts , Anakin . They betray you .
You 've made a commitment to the Jedi order a commitment not easily broken .
And do n't forget , she 's a politician . They 're not to be trusted .
She 's not like the others in the senate , Master .
It is my experience that senators focus ...
only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns ...
and they 're in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy ...
in order to get those funds . Not another lecture .
At least not on the economics of politics .
And besides , you 're generalizing .
The chancellor does n't appear to be corrupt .
Palpatine is a politician .
I have observed that he is very clever ...
in following the passions and the prejudices of the senators .
I think he 's a good man --
I sense it too .
Stay here !
What the --
What took you so long ? Oh , you know , Master .
I could n't find a speeder I liked ... There he is .
with the open cockpit and the right speed capabilities .
If you spent as long practising your sabre techniques as you do your wit ...
you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman .
I thought I already did .
Only in your mind , my very young apprentice .
Pull up , Anakin . Pull up !
You know I do n't like it when you do that .
Sorry , Master . I forgot you do n't like flying .
I do n't mind flying , but what you 're doing is suicide !
Anakin ! How many times have I told you ...
stay away from power couplings !
That was good !
Where are you going ? He went that way .
Master , if we keep this chase going any longer that creep is gonna end up deep - fried ...
and , personally , I 'd like to find out who he is and who he 's working for .
This is a short cut ... I think .
Well , you 've lost him .
I 'm deeply sorry , Master .
That was some short cut , Anakin . He went completely the other way .
Once again you 've proved -- If you 'll excuse me .
I hate it when he does that .
Anakin !
She went into the club , Master . Patience . Use the Force . Think . Sorry , Master .
He went in there to hide , not to run . Yes , Master .
Next time , try not to lose it . Yes , Master .
This weapon is your life . I try , Master .
Why do I get the feeling you 're going to be the death of me ?
Do n't say that , Master . You 're the closest thing I have to a father .
Then why do n't you listen to me ?
I am trying .
Can you see him ?
I think he is a she ...
and I think she is a changeling .
In that case , be extra careful .
Go and find her . Where are you going , Master ?
For a drink .
Thank you .
You wanna buy some death sticks ? You do n't want to sell me death sticks .
I do n't want to sell you death sticks .
You want to go home and rethink your life .
Easy .
Jedi business . Go back to your drinks .
Do you know who it was you were trying to kill ?
It was a senator from Naboo .
And who hired you ? It was just a job .
Who hired you ? Tell us .
Tell us now !
It was a bounty hunter called --
Toxic dart .
Track down this bounty hunter you must , Obi - Wan .
Most importantly , find out who he 's working for .
What about Senator Amidala ? She will still need protecting .
Handle that your Padawan will .
Anakin , escort the senator back to her home planet of Naboo .
She 'll be safer there . And do n't use registered transport .
As the leader of the opposition , it will be very difficult ...
Until caught this killer is ...
our judgement she must respect .
Anakin , go to the senate ...
and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter .
I will talk with her .
Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order .
I know her well enough to assure you of that .
Thank you , Your Excellency .
And so , they 've finally given you an assignment .
Your patience has paid off .
Your guidance more than my patience .
You do n't need guidance , Anakin .
In time , you will learn to trust your feelings .
Then you will be invincible .
I have said it many times :
You are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met .
Thank you , Your Excellency .
I see you becoming the greatest of all the Jedi , Anakin ...
even more powerful than Master Yoda .
I am concerned for my Padawan .
He is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet .
The council is confident in its decision , Obi - Wan .
The boy has exceptional skills .
But he still has much to learn , Master .
His abilities have made him , well , arrogant .
Yes . A flaw more and more common among Jedi .
Too sure of themselves they are .
Even the older , more experienced ones .
Remember , Obi - Wan , if the prophecy is true ...
your apprentice is the only one who can bring the Force back into balance .
I 'm taking an extended leave of absence .
It will be your responsibility to take my place in the senate .
Representative Binks , I know I can count on you .
Mesa honoured to be taking on dissa heavy burden .
Mesa accept this with muy , muy humility and --
Jar Jar , I do n't wish to hold you up .
I 'm sure you have a great deal to do .
Of course . Milady .
I do not like this idea of hiding .
Do n't worry . Now that the council has ordered an investigation ...
it wo n't take Master Obi - Wan long to find this bounty hunter .
I have n't worked for a year to defeat the Military Creation Act ...
to not be here when its fate is decided .
Sometimes we must let go of our pride and do what is requested of us .
Anakin , you 've grown up .
Master Obi - Wan manages not to see it .
Do n't get me wrong . Obi - Wan is a great mentor .
As wise as Master Yoda and ...
as powerful as Master Windu .
I am truly thankful to be his apprentice .
In some ways -- a lot of ways --
I 'm really ahead of him .
I 'm ready for the trials ...
but he feels that I 'm too unpredictable .
He wo n't let me move on .
That must be frustrating . It 's worse .
He 's overly critical . He never listens .
He does n't understand . It 's not fair !
All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like .
It 's the only way we grow .
I know .
Anakin do n't try to grow up too fast .
But I am grown up .
You said it yourself .
Please do n't look at me like that .
Why not ?
It makes me feel uncomfortable .
Sorry , milady .
Be safe , milady . Thank you , Captain .
Take good care of Dormé . The threat 's on you two now .
He 'll be safe with me .
You 'll be fine .
It 's not me , milady . I worry about you .
What if they realize you 've left the capital ?
Well , then my Jedi protector will have to prove how good he is .
Anakin ...
do n't do anything without first consulting either myself or the council .
Yes , Master .
I 'll get to the bottom of this plot quickly , milady .
You 'll be back here in no time .
I 'll be most grateful for your speed , Master Jedi .
It 's time to go . I know .
Anakin , may the Force be with you .
May the Force be with you , Master .
Suddenly I 'm afraid .
This is my first assignment on my own . I am too .
Do n't worry . We have R2 with us .
I do hope he does n't try anything foolish .
I 'd be more concerned about her doing something than him .
Someone to see ya , honey !
Jedi , by the looks of him .
Obi - Wan !
Hello , Dex .
Take a seat . I 'll be right with ya .
You wanna cup o ' jawa juice ? Oh , yes . Thank you .
Old buddy !
So , my friend , what can I do for ya ?
You can tell me what this is .
Well , whattaya know ! I ai n't seen one of these since I was prospectin ' ...
on Subterrel , beyond the outer rim .
Can you tell me where it came from ?
This baby belongs to them cloners .
What you got here is a Kamino sabredart .
I wonder why it did n't show up in the analysis archives .
It 's these funny little cuts on the side that give it away .
Those analysis droids only focus on symbols .
I should think that you Jedi would have more respect ...
for the difference between knowledge and wisdom .
Well , if droids could think there 'd be none of us here , would there ?
Kamino . I 'm not familiar with it . Is it in the Republic ?
No , no . It 's beyond the outer rim .
I 'd say about 1 2 parsecs outside the Rishi Maze .
Should be easy to find , even for those droids in your archives .
These Kaminoans keep to themselves .
They 're cloners . Damn good ones too .
Cloners . Are they friendly ? Depends .
Depends on what , Dex ?
On how good your manners are ...
and how big your ... pocketbook is .
Did you call for assistance ? Yes , I did .
Are you having a problem , Master Kenobi ?
Yes , I 'm looking for a planetary system called Kamino .
It does n't show up on the archive charts .
Kamino . It 's not a system I 'm familiar with .
Are you sure you have the right coordinates ?
According to my information , it should appear in this quadrant here ...
just south of the Rishi Maze .
I hate to say it , but it looks like the system you 're searching for does n't exist .
Impossible . Perhaps the archives are incomplete .
If an item does not appear in our records it does not exist .
Hey , you ! No droids ! Get outta here !
Thank you , R2 .
Must be difficult , having sworn your life to the Jedi ...
not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like .
Or be with the people that I love .
Are you allowed to love ?
I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi .
Attachment is forbidden . Possession is forbidden .
Compassion , which I would define as unconditional love ...
is central to a Jedi 's life .
So you might say that we are encouraged to love .
You 've changed so much .
You have n't changed a bit .
You 're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams .
Reach out . Sense the Force around you .
Use your feelings you must .
Younglings . Younglings !
A visitor we have .
Hello , Master Obi - Wan .
Hello . I 'm sorry to disturb you , Master .
What help can I be , Obi - Wan ?
I 'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend .
I trust him , but the systems do n't show on the archive maps .
Lost a planet Master Obi - Wan has . How embarrassing !
Liam , the shades .
Gather round the map reader .
Clear your minds ...
and find Obi - Wan 's wayward planet we will .
It ought to be here but it is n't .
Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot .
Gravity 's silhouette remains but the star and all the planets ...
disappeared they have .
How can this be ? A thought ?
Anyone .
Master ?
Because someone erased it from the archive memory .
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is .
The Padawan is right .
Go to the centre of gravity 's pull ...
and find your planet you will .
The data must have been erased .
But who could empty information from the archives ? Is n't that impossible ?
Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is .
Only a Jedi could have erased those files .
But who and why , harder to answer .
Meditate on this I will .
I was n't the youngest queen ever elected ...
but now that I think back on it , I 'm not sure I was old enough .
I 'm not sure I was ready . The people you served thought you did a good job .
I heard they even tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office .
I was relieved when my two terms were up .
But when the queen asked me to serve as senator ...
I could n't refuse her .
I agree with her . I think the Republic needs you .
I 'm glad that you chose to serve .
If the senate votes to create an army , it 's sure to push us into a civil war .
It 's unthinkable !
There has n't been a full - scale war since the formation of the Republic .
Do you see any way through negotiations to bring the separatists back into the Republic ?
Not if they feel threatened .
They 'll turn to the Trade Federations or the Commerce Guilds for help .
It 's outrageous but after four trials in the Supreme Court ...
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation .
I fear the senate is powerless to resolve this crisis .
We must keep our faith in the Republic .
The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it .
Let 's pray that day never comes .
In the meantime , we must consider your own safety .
What is your suggestion , Master Jedi ?
Anakin 's not a Jedi yet . He 's still a Padawan learner .
But I was thinking -- Hold on a minute .
Excuse me . I was thinking I would stay in the lake country .
There are some places up there that are very isolated .
Excuse me . I 'm in charge of security here , milady .
And this is my home . I know it very well . That is why we 're here .
I think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance .
Sorry , milady .
Perfect . It 's settled , then .
There it is , R4 , right where it should be .
Master Jedi .
The prime minister is expecting you .
I 'm expected ? Of course .
He is anxious to meet you .
After all these years ...
we were beginning to think you were n't coming . Now , please , this way .
May I present Lama Su ...
prime minister of Kamino .
And this is Master Jedi --
Obi - Wan Kenobi .
I trust you 're going to enjoy your stay .
Please . And now to business .
You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule .
200 , 000 units are ready ...
with a million more well on the way .
That 's good news .
Please tell your Master Sifo - Dyas ...
that his order will be met on time .
I 'm sorry . Master --
Jedi Master Sifo - Dyas is still ...
a leading member of the Jedi Council , is he not ?
Master Sifo - Dyas was killed almost ten years ago .
I 'm so sorry to hear that .
But I 'm sure he would have been proud of the army we 've built for him .
The army ?
Yes , a clone army , and I must say ...
Tell me , Prime Minister when my master first contacted you about the army ...
did he say who it was for ?
Of course he did .
This army is for the Republic .
But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself .
That 's why I 'm here .
We used to come here for school retreat .
We would swim to that island every day .
I love the water .
We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us ...
and try to guess the names of the birds singing .
I do n't like sand .
It 's coarse and rough and irritating ...
and it gets everywhere .
Not like here .
Here , everything is soft and smooth .
No . I should n't have done that .
I 'm sorry .
Very impressive .
I 'd hoped you would be pleased .
Clones can think creatively .
You will find that they are immensely superior to droids .
We take great pride in our combat education and training programmes .
This group was created about five years ago .
You mentioned growth acceleration .
Oh , yes , it 's essential .
Otherwise , a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow .
Now we can do it in half the time .
I see .
They are totally obedient taking any order without question .
We modified their genetic structure ...
to make them less independent than the original host .
And who was the original host ?
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett .
And where is this bounty hunter now ?
Oh , we keep him here .
Apart from his pay , which is considerable ...
Fett demanded only one thing :
an unaltered clone for himself .
Curious , is n't it ? " Unaltered ' ' ?
Pure genetic replication .
No tampering with the structure to make it more docile ...
and no growth acceleration .
I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett .
I would be very happy to arrange it for you .
Magnificent , are n't they ?
I do n't know .
Sure you do . You just do n't want to tell me .
You gonna use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me ?
They only work on the weak - minded .
All right .
I was 1 2 . His name was Palo . We were both in the Legislative Youth Programme .
He was a few years older than I . Very cute .
Dark , curly hair . Dreamy eyes .
All right , I get the picture .
Whatever happened to him ?
I went into public service . He went on to become an artist .
Maybe he was the smart one .
You really do n't like politicians , do you ?
I like two or three ...
but I 'm not really sure about one of them .
I do n't think the system works .
How would you have it work ?
We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem ...
agree what 's in the best interest of all the people and then do it .
That 's exactly what we do .
The trouble is that people do n't always agree .
Well , then they should be made to .
By whom ? Who 's gonna make them ? I do n't know . Someone .
You ? Of course not me .
But someone . Someone wise .
Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me .
Well , if it works .
You 're making fun of me . No .
I 'd be much too frightened to tease a senator .
Ani , are you all right ?
Boba , is your father here ?
Yep .
May we see him ?
Sure .
Jango , welcome back .
Was your trip productive ?
Fairly .
This is Jedi Master Obi - Wan Kenobi .
He 's come to check on our progress .
Your clones are very impressive . You must be very proud .
I 'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe .
Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant ?
Once or twice . Recently ?
Possibly .
Then you must know Master Sifo - Dyas .
Boba , rood eht so - heeck .
Master who ?
Sifo - Dyas .
Is he not the Jedi who hired you for this job ?
Never heard of him .
Really ?
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden . Curious .
Do you like your army ?
They 'll do their job well . I 'll guarantee that .
Thank you for your time , Jango .
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi .
What is it , Dad ?
And when I got to them , we went into aggressive negotiations .
" Aggressive negotiations ' ' ? What 's that ?
Well , negotiations with a lightsabre .
If Master Obi - Wan caught me doing this , he 'd be very grumpy .
From the moment I met you ...
all those years ago ...
not a day has gone by when I have n't thought of you .
And now that I 'm with you again ...
I 'm in agony .
The closer I get to you , the worse it gets .
The thought of not being with you --
I ca n't breathe .
I 'm haunted by the kiss ...
that you should never have given me .
My heart is beating ...
hoping that that kiss will not become a scar .
You are in my very soul tormenting me .
What can I do ? I will do anything that you ask .
If you are suffering as much as I am , please , tell me .
I ca n't .
We ca n't . It 's ... just not possible .
Anything is possible , Padmé . Listen to me .
No , you listen .
We live in a real world . Come back to it .
You 're studying to become a Jedi . I 'm a senator .
If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion ...
it 'll take us to a place we cannot go ...
regardless of the way we feel about each other .
Then you do feel something .
I will not let you give up your future for me .
You are asking me to be rational .
That is something I know I cannot do .
Believe me , I wish that I could just wish away my feelings ...
but I ca n't .
I will not give in to this .
Well , you know ...
We could keep it a secret .
We 'd be living a lie ...
one we could n't keep even if we wanted to .
I could n't do that .
No . You 're right .
It would destroy us .
Tell your council that the first battalions are ready .
And remind them , if they need more troops ...
it will take more time to grow them .
I wo n't forget , and thank you .
Thank you .
R4 !
Scramble code five to Coruscant , care of the old folks ' home !
I have successfully made contact with the prime minister of Kamino .
They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army .
I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we are looking for .
Do you think these cloners are involved ...
in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala ?
No , Master . There appears to be no motive .
Do not assume anything , Obi - Wan .
Clear your mind must be ...
if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot .
Yes , Master .
They say Master Sifo - Dyas placed an order for a clone army ...
at the request of the senate almost ten years ago .
I was under the impression he was killed before that .
Did the council ever authorize the creation of a clone army ?
No . Whoever placed that order ...
did not have the authorization of the Jedi Council .
Bring him here . Question him we will .
Yes , Master . I will report back when I have him .
Blind we are if creation of this clone army ...
I think it is time we informed the senate ...
that our ability to use the Force has diminished .
Only the dark lord of the Sith knows of our weakness .
If informed the senate is ...
multiply our adversaries will .
Mom , no .
Do n't go .
Your presence is soothing .
You had another nightmare last night .
Jedi do n't have nightmares .
I heard you .
I saw my mother .
She is suffering , Padmé .
I saw her as clearly as I see you now .
She is in pain .
I know I 'm disobeying my mandate to protect you , Senator ...
but I have to go .
I have to help her .
I 'll go with you .
I 'm sorry . I do n't have a choice .
Dad , look !
Boba , get on board !
Oh , not good .
Wait right there .
Chut - chut , Watto .
Let me help you with that .
What ? What do you want ?
Wait ! You 're a Jedi !
Whatever it is , I did n't do it .
I 'm looking for Shmi Skywalker .
Ani ? Little Ani ?
You are Ani ! It is you !
You sure sprouted , huh ?
AJedi ! Whattaya know !
Maybe you could help with some deadbeats who owe me a lot of money .
My mother .
Oh , yeah . Shmi .
She 's not mine - a no more - a . I sold her .
You sold her ? Years ago .
Sorry , Ani , but you know , business is business .
I sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars .
At least I think it was Lars .
Believe it or not , I heard he freed her and married her !
Can ya beat that , eh ?
Do you know where they are now ?
Long way from here .
Someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley , I think .
I 'd like to know .
Sure . Absolutely !
Let 's go look at my records , huh ?
Dad ! I think we 're being tracked !
He must have put a homing device on our hull .
Hang on , son . We 'll move into the asteroid field ...
and we 'll have a couple of surprises for him .
Seismic charges ! Stand by .
He does n't seem to take a hint , this guy .
Watch out !
Get him , Dad ! Fire !
Blast ! This is why I hate flying !
We got him !
We 'll just have to finish him .
R4 , prepare to jettison the spare part canisters .
Fire them now !
We wo n't be seeing him again .
Well , R4 , I think we 've waited long enough .
There 's an unusual concentration of Federation ships over there , R4 .
Stay with the ship , R2 .
Hello . How might I be of service ? I am C --
3PO ?
The maker ! Master Ani !
I knew you would return . I knew it !
And Miss Padmé . Oh , my .
Hello , 3PO .
Bless my circuits ! I 'm so pleased to see you both .
I 've come to see my mother .
I think perhaps we 'd better go indoors .
Master Owen , might I present two most important visitors .
I 'm Anakin Skywalker .
Owen Lars . This is my girlfriend , Beru . Hello .
I 'm Padmé .
I guess I 'm your stepbrother .
I had a feeling you might show up someday .
Is my mother here ?
No , she 's not .
Cliegg Lars . Shmi is my wife .
We should go inside . We have a lot to talk about .
It was just before dawn . They came out of nowhere .
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders .
Your mother had gone out early , like she always did ...
to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators .
From the tracks , she was about halfway home ...
when they took her .
Those Tuskens walk like men ...
but they 're vicious , mindless monsters .
Thirty of us went out after her . Four of us came back .
I 'd be out there with them , but after I lost my leg ...
I just could n't ride any more until I heal .
I do n't want to give up on her ...
but she 's been gone a month .
There 's little hope she 's lasted this long .
Where are you going ?
Your mother 's dead , son . Accept it .
You 're gonna have to stay here .
I wo n't be long .
We must persuade the Commerce Guild and the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty .
What about the senator from Naboo ?
Is she dead yet ?
I am not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk .
I am a man of my word , Viceroy .
With these new battle droids we 've built for you ...
you 'll have the finest army in the galaxy .
As I explained to you earlier ...
I am quite convinced that 1 0 , 000 more systems ...
will rally to our cause with your support , gentlemen .
What you are proposing could be construed as treason .
The Techno Union army ...
is at your disposal , Count .
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty .
Good . Very good .
Our friends from the Trade Federation have pledged their support ...
and when their battle droids are combined with yours ...
we shall have an army greater than any in the galaxy .
The Jedi will be overwhelmed .
The Republic will agree to any demands we make .
Mom ?
Ani ? Is it you ?
I 'm here , Mom . You 're safe .
You look so handsome .
My son .
My grown - up son .
I 'm so proud of you , Ani .
I missed you .
Now I am complete .
I love y --
Stay with me , Mom . Everything -- / I love --
I love --
Anakin !
No !
What is it ?
Pain , suffering ...
death I feel .
Something terrible has happened .
Young Skywalker is in pain ...
terrible pain .
The transmitter is working , but we 're not receiving a return signal .
Coruscant 's too far . R4 , can you boost the power ?
We 'll have to try something else .
Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo .
It 's much closer .
Anakin , do you copy ?
This is Obi - Wan Kenobi . Anakin ?
He 's not on Naboo , R4 .
I 'm going to try and widen the range .
I do hope nothing 's happened to him .
That 's Anakin 's tracking signal , all right ...
but it 's coming from Tatooine .
What in the blazes is he doing there ?
I told him to stay on Naboo .
We have n't got much time .
Anakin , do you copy ? This is Obi - Wan Kenobi .
Retransmit this message --
Anakin , do you copy ?
My long - range transmitter has been knocked out .
Retransmit this message to Coruscant .
I brought you something .
The shifter broke .
Life seems so much simpler when you 're fixing things .
I 'm good at fixing things . Always was .
Why 'd she have to die ?
Why could n't I save her ? I know I could have !
Sometimes there are things no one can fix .
You 're not all - powerful , Ani . Well , I should be !
Someday I will be .
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever .
I promise you .
I will even learn to stop people from dying .
It 's all Obi - Wan 's fault ! He 's jealous !
He 's holding me back !
What 's wrong , Ani ?
I killed them .
They 're dead .
And not just the men ...
but the women and the children too .
They 're like animals ...
and I slaughtered them like animals !
I hate them !
To be angry is to be human .
I 'm a Jedi .
I know I 'm better than this .
I know wherever you are it 's become a better place .
You were the most loving partner a man could ever have .
Goodbye , my darling wife .
And thank you .
I was n't strong enough to save you , Mom .
I was n't strong enough .
But I promise I wo n't fail again .
I miss you so much .
R2 ? What are you doing here ?
It seems that he is carrying a message from an Obi - Wan Kenobi .
Master Ani , does that name mean anything to you ?
Anakin , my long - range transmitter has been knocked out .
Retransmit this message to Coruscant .
I have tracked the bounty hunter , Jango Fett ...
to the droid foundries on Geonosis .
The Trade Federation is to take delivery of a droid army here ...
and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray ...
is behind the assassination attempts on Senator Amidala .
The Commerce Guilds and the Corporate Alliance ...
have both pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming --
More happening on Geonosis , I feel , than has been revealed .
I agree .
We will deal with Count Dooku .
The most important thing for you is to stay where you are .
Protect the senator at all costs .
That is your first priority .
Understood , Master .
They 'll never get there in time to save him .
They have to come halfway across the galaxy . Look . Geonosis is less than a parsec away .
If he 's still alive .
Are you just gonna sit here and let him die ?
He 's your friend , your mentor . He 's like my father !
But you heard Master Windu . He gave me strict orders to stay here .
He gave you strict orders to protect me ...
and I 'm going to help Obi - Wan .
If you plan to protect me , you 'll just have to come along .
I 'm not worried , R2 . It 's just I 've never flown before .
The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war . There can be no doubt of that .
Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them .
The debate is over .
Now we need that clone army .
Unfortunately , the debate is not over .
The senate will never approve the use of clones ...
before the separatists attack .
This is a crisis .
The senate must vote the chancellor emergency powers .
He can then approve the creation of an army .
But what senator would have the courage ...
to propose such a radical amendment ?
If only Senator Amidala were here .
Traitor .
Oh , no , my friend . This is a mistake , a terrible mistake . They have gone too far . This is madness .
I thought you were the leader here , Dooku .
This had nothing to do with me , I assure you .
I will petition immediately to have you set free .
Well , I hope it does n't take too long . I have work to do .
May I ask why a Jedi knight ...
is all the way out here on Geonosis ?
I 've been tracking a bounty hunter named Jango Fett .
Do you know him ?
There are no bounty hunters here that I am aware of . The Geonosians do n't trust them .
Who can blame them ? But he is here , I can assure you .
It 's a great pity our paths have never crossed before , Obi - Wan .
Qui - Gon always spoke very highly of you .
I wish he were still alive .
I could use his help right now .
Qui - Gon Jinn would never join you .
Do n't be so sure , my young Jedi .
You forget that he was once my apprentice ...
just as you were once his .
He knew all about the corruption in the senate ...
but he would n't have gone along with it if he had learned the truth as I have .
The truth ? The truth .
What if I told you that the Republic was now under the control ...
of the dark lord of the Sith ? No , that 's not possible . The Jedi would be aware of it .
The dark side of the Force has clouded their vision , my friend .
Hundreds of senators are now under the influence ...
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious .
I do n't believe you .
The viceroy of the Trade Federation ...
was once in league with this Darth Sidious ...
but he was betrayed ten years ago by the dark lord .
He came to me for help . He told me everything .
You must join me , Obi - Wan ...
and together we will destroy the Sith !
I will never join you , Dooku .
It may be difficult to secure your release .
It 's - a clear desa separatists made a pact ...
wesa desa Federation du Trade . Senators , " dellow felagates ' ' :
In response to this direct threat to the Republic ...
mesa propose that the senate ...
give immediately emergency powers ...
Palpatine ! Palpatine !
Order ! We shall have order !
It is with great reluctance ...
that I have agreed to this calling .
I love democracy . I love the Republic .
The power you give me ...
I will lay down when this crisis has abated .
And as my first act with this new authority ...
I will create a grand army of the Republic ...
to counter the increasing threats of the separatists .
It is done , then .
I will take what Jedi we have left and go to Geonosis and help Obi - Wan .
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino ...
and see this army they have created for the Republic .
See those columns of steam straight ahead ?
They 're exhaust vents of some type .
That 'll do .
Look , whatever happens out there , follow my lead .
I 'm not interested in getting into a war here .
As a member of the senate ...
maybe I can find a diplomatic solution to this mess .
Do n't worry . I 've given up trying to argue with you .
My obtuse little friend , if they had needed our help ...
they would have asked for it .
You obviously have a great deal to learn about human behaviour .
For a mechanic , you seem to do an excessive amount of thinking .
I am programmed to understand humans !
" What does that mean ? ' ' / That means I am in charge here !
Where are you going now ?
You do n't know what 's out there . Have you no sense at all ?
Idiot !
Do you know where you 're going ?
Wait .
Oh , my goodness !
Shut me down !
Machines making machines .
How perverse !
Calm down , R2 !
I almost fell .
You 'll get your chance --
I 'm scrap .
It 's a nightmare !
I want to go home !
What did I do to deserve this ?
I wonder what happened to poor little R2 .
He 's always getting himself into trouble .
Oh , no !
I 'm so confused .
Not again ! Obi - Wan 's gonna kill me .
Do n't move , Jedi ! Take him away .
Do n't be afraid .
I 'm not afraid to die .
I 've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life .
What are you talking about ?
You love me ?
I thought we had decided not to fall in love ...
that we would be forced to live a lie ...
and that it would destroy our lives .
I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway .
I truly deeply love you ...
and before we die , I want you to know .
I was beginning to wonder if you 'd got my message .
I retransmitted it just as you had requested , Master .
Then we decided to come and rescue you .
Good job .
Settle down . Settle down .
Let the executions begin .
I 've got a bad feeling about this .
Just relax . Concentrate . What about Padmé ?
She seems to be on top of things .
She ca n't do that ! Shoot her ... or something !
Jump !
This is n't how it 's supposed to be !
Jango ! Finish her off !
Patience , Viceroy , patience . She will die .
Master Windu .
How pleasant of you to join us .
This party 's over .
Brave but foolish , my old Jedi friend .
You 're impossibly outnumbered .
I do n't think so .
We 'll see .
My legs are n't moving . I must need maintenance .
What 's all this noise ? A battle !
There 's been some terrible mistake !
I 'm programmed for etiquette , not destruction !
Die , Jedi dogs !
Oh ! What did I say ?
Oh , dear . I 'm terribly sorry about all this .
Excuse me . I 'm trapped . I ca n't get up .
You call this a diplomatic solution ? No , I call it aggressive negotiations .
Uh - oh . Roger , roger .
R2 , what are you doing here ?
What are you doing ?
Stop that ! You 're going to strain something . My neck !
Now where are you taking me ? This is such a drag !
I 'm quite beside myself .
R2 , please be careful ! You 're singeing my circuits !
Yes , but is my head on straight ?
Master Windu ...
you have fought gallantly ...
worthy of recognition in the archives of the Jedi order .
Now it is finished .
Surrender and your lives will be spared .
We will not be hostages to be bartered , Dooku !
Then I 'm sorry , old friend .
Look !
Around the survivors a perimeter create .
I 've had the most peculiar dream !
If Dooku escapes ...
rally more systems to his cause he will .
Hold on !
Aim right above the fuel cells !
Good call , my young Padawan .
The Jedi have amassed a huge army .
That does n't seem possible .
How could the Jedi come up with an army so quickly ?
We must send all available droids into battle .
There are too many .
Our communications have been jammed .
Pilot , land in that assembly area !
Yes , sir .
Sir ...
I have five special commando units awaiting your orders , sir .
To the forward command centre take me .
Attack those Federation starships , quickly !
Master Yoda , all forward positions are advancing .
Very good . Very good .
This is not looking good at all !
We must get the starships back into space .
We have to order a retreat .
My master will never allow the Republic ...
to get away with this treachery .
I 'm sending my warriors to hide in the catacombs .
The Jedi must not find our designs for the ultimate weapon .
If they find out what we are planning to build , we 're doomed .
I will take the designs with me to Coruscant .
They will be much safer there with my master .
Concentrate all your fire on the nearest starship .
Yes , sir .
Move all quadrants to sector 51 5 .
Look over there !
It 's Dooku ! Shoot him down !
We 're out of rockets , sir .
Follow him ! We 're gonna need some help !
There is n't time ! Anakin and I can handle this !
Put the ship down !
Do n't let your personal feelings get in the way !
Follow that speeder !
Lower the ship ! I ca n't take Dooku alone !
I need you ! If we catch him , we can end this war right now !
We have a job to do ! I do n't care ! Put the ship down !
You will be expelled from the Jedi order !
I ca n't leave her ! Come to your senses !
What do you think Padmé would do were she in your position ?
She would do her duty .
The droid army is in full retreat .
Well done , Commander . Bring me a ship .
You 're gonna pay for all the Jedi that you killed today , Dooku .
We 'll take him together .
I 'm taking him now ! No , Anakin ! No !
As you see , my Jedi powers are far beyond yours .
Now ... back down .
I do n't think so .
Master Kenobi , you disappoint me .
Yoda holds you in such high esteem .
Surely you can do better .
Are you all right ?
We 'd better get back to the forward command centre .
No .
Gather what troops you can . We 've got to get to that hangar .
Get a transport . Hurry !
Brave of you , boy .
But I would have thought you had learned your lesson .
I am a slow learner .
Master Yoda .
Count Dooku .
You have interfered with our affairs for the last time .
Powerful you have become , Dooku .
The dark side I sense in you .
I 've become more powerful than any Jedi .
Even you .
Much to learn you still have .
It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided ...
by our knowledge of the Force ...
but by our skills with a lightsabre .
Fought well you have , my old Padawan .
This is just the beginning .
The Force is with us , Master Sidious .
Welcome home , Lord Tyranus .
You have done well .
The war has begun . Excellent .
Do you believe what Count Dooku said about Sidious controlling the senate ?
It does n't feel right .
Joined the dark side Dooku has .
Lies , deceit ...
creating mistrust are his ways now .
Nevertheless ..
I feel we should keep a closer eye on the senate .
I agree .
Where is your apprentice ?
On his way to Naboo , escorting Senator Amidala home .
I have to admit that without the clones , it would not have been a victory .
Victory ?
Master Obi - Wan , not victory .
The shroud of the dark side has fallen .
Begun the Clone War has .
Did you hear that ?
They shut down the main reactor . We 'll be destroyed for sure .
This is madness .
We 're doomed .
There 'll be no escape for the princess this time .
What 's that ?
R2 - D2 , where are you ?
At last . Where have you been ?
They 're heading in this direction . What are we going to do ?
We 'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines or smashed into who knows what .
Wait a minute . Where are you going ?
The Death Star plans are not in the main computer .
Where are those transmissions you intercepted ?
What have you done with those plans ?
We intercepted no transmissions .
This is a consular ship . We 're on a diplomatic mission .
If this is a consular ship , where is the ambassador ?
Commander , tear this ship apart until you 've found those plans !
And bring me the passengers ! I want them alive !
There 's one . Set for stun .
She 'll be all right . Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner .
Hey . You 're not permitted in there . It 's restricted .
You 'll be deactivated for sure .
Do n't call me a mindless philosopher , you overweight glob of grease .
Come out , before somebody sees you .
Secret mission ? What plans ?
What are you talking about ? I 'm not getting in there .
I 'm going to regret this .
There goes another one . Hold your fire . There 's no life forms .
It must have short - circuited .
That 's funny . The damage does n't look as bad from out here .
Are you sure this thing is safe ?
Darth Vader . Only you could be so bold .
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this .
You 've attacked a diplomatic -- Do n't act so surprised , Your Highness .
You were n't on any mercy mission this time .
Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies .
I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you .
I do n't know what you 're talking about .
I 'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan .
You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor .
Take her away !
Holding her is dangerous . If word gets out ...
it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate .
I have traced the rebel spies to her .
Now she is my only link to finding their secret base .
She 'll die before she 'll tell you anything .
Leave that to me .
Send a distress signal , and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed .
Lord Vader , the battle station plans are not aboard this ship ...
and no transmissions were made .
An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting , but no life forms were aboard .
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod .
Send a detachment down to retrieve them . See to it personally , Commander .
There 'll be no one to stop us this time . Yes , sir .
How did we get into this mess ? I really do n't know how .
We seem to be made to suffer . It 's our lot in life .
I 've got to rest before I fall apart . My joints are almost frozen .
What a desolate place this is .
Where do you think you 're going ?
Well , I 'm not going that way . It 's much too rocky .
This way is much easier . What makes you think there are settlements over there ?
Do n't get technical with me .
What mission ? What are you talking about ?
I 've just about had enough of you .
Go that way . You 'll be malfunctioning within a day , you nearsighted scrap pile .
And do n't let me catch you following me , begging for help ...
No more adventures . I 'm not going that way .
That malfunctioning little twerp . This is all his fault .
He tricked me into going this way but he 'll do no better .
Wait . What 's that ?
A transport . I 'm saved .
Over here !
Hey ! Hey !
Help ! Please help !
R2 ?
R2 - D2 , it is you ! It is you !
Someone was in the pod . The tracks go off in this direction .
Look , sir . Droids .
We stopped .
Wake up . Wake up !
We 're doomed .
Do you think they 'll melt us down ?
Do n't shoot . Do n't shoot .
Will this never end ?
Fine . Let 's go . Luke !
Luke !
Luke , tell Uncle if he gets a translator , be sure it speaks Bocce .
Does n't look like we have much choice , but I 'll remind him .
Yeah , we 'll take that red one .
No , not that one .
I suppose you 're programmed for etiquette and protocol .
Protocol ? It 's my primary function , sir . I am well - versed in all the customs --
I have no need for a protocol droid . Of course you have n't , sir .
Not in an environment such as this . That 's why I have been programmed --
I need a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators .
Vaporators ? Sir , my first job was programming binary load lifters ...
very similar to your vaporators in most respects . very similar to your vaporators in most respects .
Can you speak Bocce ? Of course . It 's like a second language .
All right . Shut up . I 'll take this one . Shutting up , sir .
Take these two to the garage . I want them cleaned up before dinner .
But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters .
You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done .
Now come on . Get to it .
And the red one . Come on .
Come on , red . Let 's go .
Uncle Owen . Yeah ?
This R2 unit has a bad motivator . Look .
Hey , what are you trying to push on us ?
Excuse me , sir , but that R2 unit is in prime condition , a real bargain .
Uncle Owen , what about that one ?
What about that blue one ? We 'll take that one .
Take this away . You 'll be pleased with that one , sir . He really is in first - class condition .
I 've worked with him before . Here he comes .
Let 's go .
Do n't you forget this .
Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity .
Thank the maker . This oil bath is going to feel so good .
I 've got such a bad case of dust contamination I can barely move .
It just is n't fair .
Biggs is right . I 'm never gonna get out of here .
Is there anything I might do to help ?
No , not unless you can alter time , speed up the harvest ...
or teleport me off this rock .
I do n't think so , sir .
I 'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things .
Not on this planet , anyway .
As a matter of fact , I 'm not even sure which planet I 'm on .
Well , if there 's a bright centre to the universe you 're on the planet that it 's farthest from .
I see , sir .
You can call me Luke . I see , Sir Luke .
Just Luke .
And I am C - 3PO , human - cyborg relations .
This is my counterpart , R2 - D2 .
Hello .
A lot of carbon scoring here . Looks like you 've seen a lot of action .
With all we 've been through , I 'm amazed we 're in as good condition as we are ...
You know of the rebellion against the Empire ?
That 's how we came to be in your service , if you take my meaning , sir .
Have you been in many battles ? Several , I think .
I 'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories .
Well , not at making them interesting , anyway .
Well , my little friend you got something jammed in here real good .
Were you on a Starcruiser or --
Help me , Obi - Wan Kenobi . You 're my only hope .
What 's this ?
" What is what ' ' ? He asked you a question . What is that ?
Help me , Obi - Wan Kenobi . You 're my only hope .
Help me , Obi - Wan Kenobi . You 're my only hope .
He says it 's nothing , sir , merely a malfunction .
Old data . Pay it no mind .
Who is she ? She 's beautiful .
I 'm afraid I 'm not quite sure , sir .
I think she was a passenger on our last voyage .
A person of some importance , I believe .
Our captain was -- Is there any more to this recording ?
Behave yourself , R2 . You 're going to get us into trouble .
It 's all right . You can trust him . He 's our new master .
You 're my only hope .
He says he 's the property of Obi - Wan Kenobi , a resident of these parts ...
and it 's a private message for him .
Frankly , I do n't know what he 's talking about .
Our last master was Captain Antilles .
But with all we 've been through , this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric .
Obi - Wan Kenobi . I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi .
I beg your pardon , sir , but do you know what he 's talking about ?
I do n't know anyone named Obi - Wan ...
but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea .
He 's kind of a strange old hermit .
I wonder who she is .
Sounds like she 's in trouble . I better play back the whole thing .
He says the restraining bolt has short - circuited his recording system .
He suggests that if you remove the bolt ...
he might be able to play back the entire recording .
Oh , yeah . Well I guess you 're too small to run away on me if I take this off .
There you go .
Where 'd she go ? Bring her back . Play back the entire message .
" What message ' ' ? The one you 've just been playing .
The one you 're carrying inside your rusty innards .
Luke ! Luke !
I 'll be right there , Aunt Beru .
I 'm sorry , sir , but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter .
Here . See what you can do with him . I 'll be right back .
Just you reconsider playing that message for him .
No , I do n't think he likes you at all .
That R2 unit might have been stolen . What makes you think that ?
I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him .
He says he belongs to someone called Obi - Wan Kenobi .
I thought he might have meant old Ben . Do you know what he 's talking about ?
I wonder if he 's related to Ben .
That wizard 's just a crazy old man .
Tomorrow , take that R2 unit to Anchorhead and have its memory erased .
That 'll be the end of it . It belongs to us now .
But what if this Obi - Wan comes looking for him ?
He wo n't .
I do n't think he exists any more . He died about the same time as your father .
He knew my father ? I told you to forget it .
Your only concern is to prepare those new droids for tomorrow .
In the morning , I want them on the south ridge working on those condensers .
Yes , sir .
I think those new droids are gonna work out fine .
In fact , I was also thinking about our agreement --
about me staying on another season .
If these new droids work out , I want to apply to the academy this year .
You mean the next semester before the harvest ?
Sure . There 's more than enough droids .
Harvest is when I need you the most .
It 's only one season more .
This year we 'll make enough on the harvest to hire more hands ...
and then you can go to the academy next year .
You must understand I need you here , Luke .
But it 's a whole ' nother year . It 's only one more season .
That 's what you said when Biggs and Tank left .
Where are you going ? Looks like I 'm going nowhere .
Owen , he ca n't stay here forever . Most of his friends have gone .
It means so much to him .
I 'll make it up to him next year . I promise .
Luke 's just not a farmer , Owen . He has too much of his father in him .
That 's what I 'm afraid of .
What are you doing hiding back there ? It was n't my fault , sir .
Please do n't deactivate me . I told him not to go , but he 's faulty , malfunctioning .
Kept babbling on about his mission . Oh , no .
That R2 unit has always been a problem .
These astrodroids are getting quite out of hand .
Even I ca n't understand their logic at times .
How could I be so stupid ? He 's nowhere in sight .
Blast it . Could n't we go after him ?
It 's too dangerous with the Sandpeople around . We 'll have to wait till morning .
Luke , I 'm shutting the power down .
I 'll be there in a few minutes .
Boy , am I gonna get it .
That droid 's gonna cause me trouble . He excels at that , sir .
Come on .
Have you seen Luke this morning ?
He said he had things to do before he started today , so he left early .
Did he take those new droids with him ? I think so .
He better have those units in the south range repaired by midday or there 'll be hell to pay .
There 's a droid on the scanner . Dead ahead .
It might be our little R2 unit . Hit the accelerator .
Where do you think you 're going ?
Master Luke is your rightful owner now .
We 'll have no more of this Obi - Wan Kenobi gibberish .
Do n't talk to me of your mission .
You 're fortunate he does n't blast you into a million pieces right here .
No . It 's all right , but I think we 'd better go .
What 's wrong with him now ?
There are several creatures approaching from the southeast .
Sandpeople . Or worse .
Come on . Let 's go have a look .
Come on .
There are two Banthas down there , but I do n't see any --
Wait a second .
Hello there .
Come here , my little friend . Do n't be afraid .
Do n't worry . He 'll be all right .
Rest easy , son . You 've had a busy day .
You 're fortunate to be all in one piece .
Ben ? Ben Kenobi ?
Boy , am I glad to see you .
The Jundland Wastes are not to be travelled lightly .
Tell me , young Luke , what brings you out this far ?
This little droid .
He 's searching for his former master ...
but I 've never seen such devotion in a droid .
He claims to be the property of an Obi - Wan Kenobi .
Is he a relative of yours ? Do you know who he 's talking about ?
Obi - Wan Kenobi ?
Obi - Wan .
Now , that 's a name I 've not heard in a long time .
A long time .
I think my uncle knows him . He said he was dead .
He 's not dead .
Not yet .
You know him ? Of course I know him .
I have n't gone by the name of Obi - Wan ...
since , oh , before you were born .
Then the droid does belong to you .
I do n't seem to remember ever owning a droid .
Very interesting .
I think we better get indoors .
The Sandpeople are easily startled ...
but they 'll soon be back -- and in greater numbers .
3PO .
Where am I ? I must have taken a bad step .
Can you stand ? We 've gotta get out of here before the Sandpeople return .
I do n't think I can make it . You go on , Master Luke .
There 's no sense in you risking yourself on my account . I 'm done for .
No , you 're not . What kind of talk is that ?
Quickly . They 're on the move .
My father did n't fight in the wars . He was a navigator on a spice freighter .
That 's what your uncle told you . He did n't hold with your father 's ideals .
Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved .
You fought in the Clone Wars ? Yes .
I was once a Jedi knight , the same as your father .
I wish I 'd known him .
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy ...
and a cunning warrior .
I understand you 've become quite a good pilot yourself .
And he was a good friend .
Which reminds me ...
I have something here for you .
Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough ...
but your uncle would n't allow it .
He feared you might follow old Obi - Wan on some damn - fool idealistic crusade , like your father did .
Sir , if you 'll not be needing me , I 'll close down for a while .
Go ahead .
What is it ? It 's your father 's lightsabre .
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight .
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster .
An elegant weapon ...
for a more civilized age .
For over a thousand generations ...
the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic ...
before the dark times before the Empire .
How did my father die ?
Ayoung Jedi named Darth Vader ...
who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil ...
helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights .
He betrayed and murdered your father .
Now the Jedi are all but extinct .
Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force .
The Force ?
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power .
It 's an energy field created by all living things .
It surrounds us and penetrates us .
It binds the galaxy together .
Let 's see if we ca n't figure out what you are , little friend ...
and where you come from .
I saw part of a message -- I seem to have found it .
General Kenobi , years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars .
Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire .
I regret that I am unable to present my father 's request in person .
But my ship has fallen under attack ...
and my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed .
I have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion ...
into the memory systems of this R2 unit .
My father will know how to retrieve it .
You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan .
This is our most desperate hour .
Help me , Obi - Wan Kenobi . You 're my only hope .
You must learn the ways of the Force if you 're to come with me to Alderaan .
Alderaan ?
I 'm not going to Alderaan .
I 've gotta get home . I 'm in for it as it is .
I need your help , Luke . She needs your help .
I 'm getting too old for this sort of thing .
I ca n't get involved . I 've got work to do .
It 's not that I like the Empire . I hate it .
But there 's nothing I can do about it right now .
It 's all such a long way from here . That 's your uncle talking .
Oh , boy . My uncle . How am I ever gonna explain this ?
Learn about the Force , Luke .
I can take you as far as Anchorhead .
You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you 're going .
You must do what you feel is right , of course .
Until this battle station is fully operational , we are vulnerable .
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped .
They 're more dangerous than you realize .
Dangerous to your starfleet , Commander not to this battle station .
The rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate --
The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us .
I 've just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently .
The last remnants of the old Republic have been swept away .
That 's impossible .
How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy ?
The regional governors now have direct control over their territories .
Fear will keep the local systems in line .
Fear of this battle station . And what of the rebellion ?
If the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station ...
it is possible , however unlikely that they might find a weakness and exploit it .
The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands .
Any attack by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture ...
no matter what technical data they 've obtained .
This station is now the ultimate power in the universe .
I suggest we use it .
Do n't be too proud of this technological terror you 've constructed .
The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant ...
Do n't try to frighten us with your sorcerer 's ways , Lord Vader .
Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes ...
or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels ' hidden fortress --
I find your lack of faith disturbing .
Enough of this . Vader , release him .
As you wish .
This bickering is pointless .
Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress ...
by the time this station is operational .
We will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke .
It looks like the Sandpeople did this . There 's gaffi sticks , Bantha tracks .
I 've just never heard of them hitting anything this big before .
They did n't , but we are meant to think they did .
Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers .
These are the same Jawas that sold us R2 and 3PO .
And these blast points , too accurate for Sandpeople .
Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise .
But why would imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas ?
If they traced the robots here , they may have learned who they sold them to ...
and that would lead them back ... home .
Wait , Luke .
It 's too dangerous .
Uncle Owen . Aunt Beru .
Now , Your Highness , we will discuss the location ...
There 's nothing you could have done , had you been there .
You 'd have been killed too ...
and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire .
I want to come with you to Alderaan .
There 's nothing for me here now .
I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father .
Mos Eisley spaceport .
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy .
We must be cautious .
How long have you had these droids ?
Three or four seasons . They 're up for sale if you want them .
Let me see your identification .
You do n't need to see his identification .
We do n't need to see his identification .
These are n't the droids you 're looking for .
These are n't the droids we 're looking for .
He can go about his business .
You can go about your business . Move along .
Move along .
I ca n't abide those Jawas . Disgusting creatures .
Go on , go on .
I ca n't understand how we got by those troops . I thought we were dead .
The Force can have a strong influence on the weak - minded .
You really think we 're gonna find a pilot here to take us to Alderaan ?
Most of the best freighter pilots are to be found here .
Only watch your step -- this place can be a little rough .
I 'm ready for anything .
Come along , R2 .
Hey . We do n't serve their kind here . What ?
Your droids -- they 'll have to wait outside . We do n't want them here .
Wait out by the speeder . We do n't want any trouble .
I heartily agree with you , sir .
I 'll have one of those .
He does n't like you . I 'm sorry .
I do n't like you either . You just watch yourself .
We 're wanted men . I have the death sentence on 12 systems .
I 'll be careful then . You 'll be dead .
This little one 's not worth the effort .
Come , let me get you something .
I 'm all right .
Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us .
I do n't like the look of this .
Han Solo . I 'm captain of the Millennium Falcon .
Chewie here tells me you 're looking for passage to the Alderaan system .
Yes , indeed , if it 's a fast ship .
Fast ship ? You 've never heard of the Millennium Falcon ?
Should I have ?
It 's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs .
I 've outrun imperial starships .
Not the local bulk cruisers , mind you .
I 'm talking about the big Corellian ships now .
She 's fast enough for you , old man .
What 's the cargo ? Only passengers --
myself , the boy , two droids ...
and no questions asked .
Is it some kind of local trouble ?
Let 's just say we 'd like to avoid any imperial entanglements .
Well , that 's the real trick , is n't it ?
And it 's gonna cost you something extra .
10 , 000 , all in advance .
10 , 000 ?
We could almost buy our own ship for that .
But who 's gonna fly it , kid ? You ?
You bet I could . I 'm not such a bad pilot .
We do n't have to sit here and listen --
We can pay you 2 , 000 now ...
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan .
Seventeen ?
Okay , you guys got yourselves a ship .
We 'll leave as soon as you 're ready . Docking Bay 94 .
Ninety - four .
Looks like somebody 's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork .
All right . We 'll check it out .
17 , 000 . Those guys must really be desperate .
This could really save my neck . Get back to the ship , get it ready .
You 'll have to sell your speeder . That 's okay .
I 'm never coming back to this planet again .
Going somewhere , Solo ?
Yes , Greedo . As a matter of fact , I was just going to see your boss .
Tell Jabba that I 've got his money .
It 's too late . You should have paid him when you had the chance .
Jabba 's put a price on your head so large every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you .
I 'm lucky I found you first .
Yeah , but this time I 've got the money .
If you give it to me , I might forget I found you .
I do n't have it with me . Tell Jabba --
Jabba 's through with you .
He has no time for smugglers ...
who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser .
Even I get boarded sometimes . Do you think I had a choice ?
You can tell that to Jabba . He may only take your ship .
Over my dead body .
That 's the idea .
I 've been looking forward to this for a long time .
I 'll bet you have .
Sorry about the mess .
Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable .
It 'll be some time before we can extract any information from her .
The final checkout is completed . All systems are operational .
What course shall we set ?
Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion .
What do you mean ?
I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station .
Set your course for Alderaan . With pleasure .
Lock the door , R2 .
Check this side of the street .
The door 's locked . Move on to the next one .
I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you .
I do n't know what this trouble is about , but I 'm sure it must be your fault .
Watch your language .
All right . Give it to me . I 'll take it .
Look at this . Ever since the XP - 38 came out , they just are n't in demand .
It 'll be enough .
Solo ! Come out of there , Solo ! Right here , Jabba .
I 've been waitin ' for you .
Have you now .
You did n't think I was gonna run , did you ?
Han , my boy , you disappoint me .
Why have n't you paid me ...
and why did you fry poor Greedo ?
Jabba , next time you wanna talk to me , come yourself . Do n't send these twerps .
Han , I ca n't make exceptions .
What if everyone who smuggled for me ...
dropped their cargo at the first sign of an imperial starship ?
It 's not good business .
Look , Jabba , even I get boarded sometimes .
You think I had a choice ?
But I got a nice , easy charter .
I 'll pay ya back , plus a little extra . I just need a little more time .
Han , my boy , you 're the best .
So , for an extra 20 % --
Fifteen , Jabba . Do n't push it .
Okay , 15 % .
But if you fail me again ...
I 'll put a price on your head so big ...
you wo n't be able to go near a civilized system .
Jabba , you 're a wonderful human being .
Come on !
If the ship 's as fast as he 's boasting , we ought to do well .
What a piece of junk .
She 'll make . 5 past light speed .
She may not look like much , but she 's got it where it counts , kid .
I 've made a lot of special modifications myself .
But we 're a little rushed , so if you 'll just get on board , we 'll get outta here .
Hello , sir .
Which way ?
All right , men , load your weapons .
Stop that ship . Blast them .
Chewie , get us out of here !
Oh , my . I 'd forgotten how much I hate space travel .
Looks like an imperial cruiser . Our passengers are hotter than I thought .
Hold ' em off . Angle the deflector shields ...
while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed .
Stay sharp . There 's two more comin ' . They 're gonna try and cut us off .
Why do n't you outrun ' em ? I thought this thing was fast .
Watch your mouth , or you 're gonna find yourself floating home .
We 'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace .
Besides , I know a few manoeuvres . We 'll lose ' em .
Here 's where the fun begins .
How long before you can jump to light speed ?
It 'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer .
At the rate they 're gaining ?
Travelling through hyperspace ai n't like dustin ' crops , boy .
Without precise calculations ...
we 'd fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova ...
and that would end your trip real quick .
What 's that flashing ? We 're losing a deflector shield .
Go strap yourselves in . I 'm gonna make the jump to light speed .
We 've entered the Alderaan system .
Governor Tarkin . I should have expected to find you holding Vader 's leash .
I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board .
Charming to the last .
You do n't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life .
I 'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself .
Princess Leia , before your execution ...
I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational .
No star system will dare oppose the emperor now .
The more you tighten your grip , Tarkin ...
the more star systems will slip through your fingers .
Not after we demonstrate the power of this station .
In a way , you have determined the choice of the planet ...
Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base ...
I have chosen to test this station 's destructive power on your home planet of Alderaan .
No . Alderaan is peaceful . We have no weapons .
You would prefer another target ? A military target ?
Then name the system .
I grow tired of asking this , so it will be the last time .
Where is the rebel base ?
Dantooine .
They 're on Dantooine .
There . You see , Lord Vader ? She can be reasonable .
Continue with the operation . You may fire when ready .
What ? You 're far too trusting .
Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration .
But do n't worry . We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough .
Commence primary ignition .
Are you all right ? What 's wrong ?
I felt a great disturbance in the Force ...
as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror ...
and were suddenly silenced .
I fear something terrible has happened .
You 'd better get on with your exercises .
You can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs .
I told you I 'd outrun them .
Do n't everybody thank me at once .
Anyway , we should be at Alderaan about 0200 hours .
Now be careful , R2 .
He made a fair move . Screaming about it ca n't help you .
Let him have it . It 's not wise to upset a Wookiee .
But , sir , nobody worries about upsetting a droid .
' Cause a droid do n't pull people 's arms out of their sockets when they lose .
Wookiees are known to do that .
I see your point , sir .
I suggest a new strategy , R2 . Let the Wookiee win .
Remember , a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him .
You mean it controls your actions ? Partially .
But it also obeys your commands .
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a blaster at your side .
You do n't believe in the Force , do you ?
Kid , I 've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other .
I 've seen a lot of strange stuff ...
but I 've never seen anything to make me believe there 's one all - powerful force controlling everything .
There 's no mystical energy field controls my destiny .
It 's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense .
I suggest you try it again , Luke .
This time , let go your conscious self ...
and act on instinct .
With the blast shield down , I ca n't see . How am I supposed to fight ?
Your eyes can deceive you . Do n't trust them .
Stretch out with your feelings .
You see ? You can do it .
I call it luck .
In my experience , there 's no such thing as luck .
Good against remotes is one thing .
Good against the living , that 's something else .
We 're coming up on Alderaan .
I did feel something . I could almost see the remote .
That 's good . You 've taken your first step into a larger world .
Yes ?
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine .
They found the remains of a rebel base ...
but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time .
They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems .
She lied . She lied to us .
I told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion .
Terminate her immediately .
Stand by , Chewie . Cut in the sublight engines .
What the --
We 've come out in a meteor shower , some kind of asteroid collision .
It 's not on any of the charts . What 's going on ?
Our position 's correct , except no Alderaan .
Where is it ? That 's what I 'm trying to tell you .
It ai n't there . It 's been blown away .
What ? How ? Destroyed by the Empire .
The entire starfleet could n't destroy the whole planet .
It 'd take a thousand ships with more firepower than I 've --
There 's another ship coming in . Maybe they know what happened .
It 's an imperial fighter .
It followed us . No . It 's a short - range fighter .
There are n't any bases here . Where did it come from ?
Sure is leaving in a hurry . If they identify us , we 're in trouble .
Not if I can help it . Chewie , jam its transmissions .
Let it go . It 's too far out of range . Not for long .
A fighter that size could n't get this deep into space on its own .
He must have gotten lost , been part of a convoy or something .
He ai n't gonna be around long enough to tell anybody about us .
He 's heading for that small moon .
I can get him before he gets there . He 's almost in range .
That 's no moon .
It 's a space station . It 's too big to be a space station .
I have a very bad feeling about this .
Turn the ship around .
Yeah . I think you 're right . Full reverse .
Chewie , lock in the auxiliary power .
Chewie , lock in the auxiliary power .
Why are we still moving towards it ?
A tractor beam 's pulling us in .
There 's gotta be something you can do .
There 's nothing I can do . I 'm at full power . I have to shut down .
They 're not gonna get me without a fight .
You ca n't win , but there are alternatives to fighting .
Clear Bay 327 .
We are opening the magnetic field .
To your stations . Come with me .
Close all outboard shields . Close all outboard shields .
Yes ?
We 've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system .
Its markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley .
They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess .
She may yet be of some use to us .
Unlock 1 , 5 , 7 and 9 . Release charge .
316 , report to control .
There 's no one on board , sir .
According to the log , the crew abandoned ship right after take - off .
It must be a decoy . Several escape pods have been jettisoned .
Did you find any droids ? No , sir .
If there were any , they must have jettisoned .
Send a scanning crew aboard . I want every part of this ship checked .
Yes , sir .
I sense something ...
a presence I 've not felt since --
Get me a scanning crew in here . I want every part of this ship checked .
There 's no one here .
Boy , it 's lucky you had these compartments .
I use them for smuggling . I never thought I 'd be smuggling myself in ' em .
This is ridiculous . Even if I could take off , I 'd never get past the tractor beam .
Leave that to me .
Damn fool . I knew you were gonna say that .
Who 's the more foolish , the fool or the fool who follows him ?
The ship 's all yours . If the scanners pick up anything , report it immediately .
Let 's go .
Hey , down there .
Could you give us a hand with this ?
TK - 421 , why are n't you at your post ?
TK - 421 , do you copy ?
Take over . We 've got a bad transmitter . I 'll see what I can do .
Between his howling and your blasting everything ...
it 's a wonder the whole station does n't know we 're here .
Bring ' em on . I prefer a straight fight to sneakin ' around .
We 've found the computer outlet , sir .
Plug in . He should be able to interpret the entire imperial network .
He 's found the controls to the power beam that 's holding the ship here .
He 'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor .
The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations .
A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave .
I do n't think you boys can help . I must go alone .
Whatever you say . I 've done more than I bargained for on this trip already .
I want to go with you . Be patient , Luke . Watch the droids .
They must be delivered safely ...
or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan .
Your destiny lies along a different path from mine .
The Force will be with you ...
always .
You said it , Chewie .
Where did you dig up that old fossil ?
Ben is a great man .
Great at getting us into trouble . I did n't hear you give any ideas .
Anything 's better than just hangin ' around waiting for ' em to pick us up .
Who do you think --
What is it ? I 'm afraid I 'm not quite sure , sir .
He says , " I 've found her , ' ' and keeps repeating , " She 's here . ' '
Who ? Who has he found ?
Princess Leia . The princess ? She 's here ?
Princess ? Where is she ?
Princess ? What 's going on ?
Level 5 , Detention Block AA - 23 .
I 'm afraid she 's scheduled to be terminated .
Oh , no . We 've gotta do something .
What are you talking about ? The droids belong to her .
Do n't get any funny ideas . The old man wants us to wait here .
He did n't know she was here . Find a way into that detention block .
I 'm not going anywhere . They 're gonna execute her .
You said you did n't want to just wait to be captured . Now you want to stay ?
Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind .
But they 're gonna kill her . Better her than me .
She 's rich .
Rich ?
Rich , powerful . If you were to rescue her , the reward would be --
What ? Well , more well than you can imagine .
I do n't know . I can imagine quite a bit .
You 'll get it . I better .
All right , kid . You better be right about this . All right . What 's your plan ?
3PO , hand me those binders there , will you ?
Okay .
Now , I 'm gonna put these on you .
Okay , Han , you put those on .
Do n't worry , Chewie . I think I know what he has in mind .
Master Luke , sir , pardon me for asking ...
but what should R2 and I do if we 're discovered here ?
Lock the door . And hope they do n't have blasters .
That is n't very reassuring .
517 to scanner control . 517 to scanner control .
I ca n't see a thing in this helmet .
This is not gonna work . Why did n't you say so before ?
I did say so before .
Where are you taking this ... thing ?
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138 .
I was n't notified . I 'll have to clear it .
Look out ! He 's loose ! He 'll tear us all apart !
Look out .
We gotta find out which cell this princess of yours is in .
Here it is -- 2187 . You go and get her .
I 'll hold them here .
Everything 's under control . Situation normal .
What happened ?
Had a slight weapons malfunction ...
but everything 's perfectly all right now .
We 're fine . We 're all fine here now . Thank you .
How are you ? We 're sending a squad up .
Negative , negative . We have a reactor leak here now .
Give us a few minutes to lock it down . Large leak , very dangerous .
Who is this ? What 's your operating number ?
Boring conversation anyway . Luke , we 're gonna have company !
Are n't you a little short for a stormtrooper ?
Oh , the uniform .
I 'm Luke Skywalker . I 'm here to rescue you .
You 're who ? I 'm here to rescue you .
I 've got your R2 unit . I 'm here with Ben Kenobi .
Where is he ? Come on .
He is here . Obi - Wan Kenobi ?
What makes you think so ? A tremor in the Force .
The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master .
Surely he must be dead by now .
Do n't underestimate the Force .
The Jedi are extinct . Their fire has gone out of the universe .
You , my friend , are all that 's left of their religion .
Yes .
We have an emergency alert in Detention Block AA - 23 .
The princess ? Put all sections on alert .
Obi - Wan is here . The Force is with him .
If you 're right , he must not be allowed to escape .
Escape is not his plan . I must face him alone .
Get behind me .
Watch your left . They went down the cell bay .
Ca n't get out that way . You cut off our only escape route .
Maybe you 'd like it back in your cell , Your Highness .
C - 3PO . C - 3PO . Yes , sir ?
Are there any other ways out of the cell bay ? We 've been cut off .
What was that ? I did n't copy .
I said all systems have been alerted to your presence , sir .
The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out .
All other information on your level is restricted .
Open up in there . Open up in there .
Oh , no .
There is n't any other way out .
I ca n't hold them off forever . Now what ?
Some rescue . When you came in here , did n't you have a plan for getting out ?
He 's the brains , sweetheart .
Well , I did n't --
What the hell are you doing ? Somebody has to save our skins .
Into the garbage chute , fly boy .
Get in !
Get in there , you big furry oaf . I do n't care what you smell .
Get in there , and do n't worry about it .
Wonderful girl .
Either I 'm gonna kill her , or I 'm beginning to like her .
Get in there .
The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea .
What an incredible smell you 've discovered .
Let 's get out of here . Get away from there . No , wait .
I already tried it ! It 's magnetically sealed .
Put that thing away ! You 're gonna get us all killed !
Absolutely , Your Worship .
Look , I had everything under control till you led us down here .
It 's not gonna take ' em long to figure out what happened to us .
It could be worse .
It 's worse .
There 's something alive in here . That 's your imagination .
Something just moved past my leg .
Look . Did you see that ?
What ?
Kid ! Luke !
Grab hold of this !
Blast it ! My gun 's jammed .
Where ? Anywhere !
Help him !
What happened ? I do n't know .
I got a bad feeling about this .
The walls are moving ! Try and brace it with something .
Help me .
Wait a minute .
3PO ! Come in , 3PO !
3PO ! Where could he be ?
Take over . See to him .
Look , there .
They 're madmen . They 're heading for the prison level .
If you hurry , you might catch them .
Follow me .
You stand guard .
Come on .
All this excitement has overrun the circuits in my counterpart here .
If you do n't mind , I 'd like to take him down to maintenance .
All right .
3PO . Come in , 3PO . 3PO .
Get on top . I ca n't .
Where could he be ? 3PO .
3PO , will you come in .
They are n't here . Something must have happened .
See if they 've been captured . Hurry .
One thing 's for sure . We 're all gonna be a lot thinner .
Get on top of it . I 'm trying .
Thank goodness they have n't found them . Where could they be ?
" Use the comlink ' ' ? Oh , my . I forgot . I turned it off .
Are you there , sir ? 3PO ?
We 've had some problems . Shut up and listen to me .
Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level . Do you copy ?
Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level !
Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level !
No , shut them all down . Hurry ! Oh , no .
What ?
You did great , 3PO !
Listen to them . They 're dying , R2 .
Curse my metal body . I was n't fast enough .
It 's all my fault . My poor master .
We 're all right . You did great !
Hey ! Open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number -- Where are we ?
3263827 .
If we can avoid any more female advice , we oughta be able to get out of here .
Let 's get moving .
Where you goin ' ?
Wait ! They 'll hear !
Come here , you big coward .
Chewie , come here . Listen .
I do n't know who you are or where you came from ...
but from now on , you do as I tell you , okay ?
Look , Your Worshipfulness , let 's get one thing straight .
I take orders from just one person -- me .
It 's a wonder you 're still alive .
Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way ?
No reward is worth this .
Give me regular reports , please .
Right .
Do you know what 's going on ? Maybe it 's another drill .
You seen that new VT - 16 ?
Yeah . Some of the other guys were telling me about it . They say it 's quite a thing to see .
What was that ?
It 's nothing . Outgassing . Do n't worry about it .
There she is . C - 3PO , do you copy ?
Yes , sir .
Are you safe ? For the moment .
We 're in the main hangar across from the ship .
We 're right above you . Stand by .
You came in that thing ? You 're braver than I thought .
Nice . Come on .
It 's them . Blast them .
Get back to the ship !
Where are you going ? He certainly has courage .
What good will it do us if he gets himself killed ? Come on .
I think we took a wrong turn .
There 's no lock .
That oughta hold them for a while . Quick . We 've got to get across .
Find the controls to extend the bridge . I think I just blasted it .
They 're coming through .
Here , hold this .
Here they come .
For luck .
We think they may be splitting up . They may be on Level 5 and 6 now , sir .
Where could they be ?
Close the blast doors .
Open the blast doors . Open the blast doors .
I 've been waiting for you , Obi - Wan . We meet again at last .
The circle is now complete .
When I left you , I was but the learner .
Now I am the master .
Only a master of evil , Darth .
Your powers are weak , old man .
You ca n't win , Darth . If you strike me down ...
I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine .
You should not have come back .
Did n't we just leave this party ?
What kept you ? We ran into some old friends .
The ship all right ? Seems okay , if we can get to it .
I hope the old man got the tractor beam down .
Look .
Come on , R2 . We 're going .
Now 's our chance . Go !
Come on !
Come on !
Luke , it 's too late ! Blast the door , kid !
Run , Luke , run .
I hope that old man got the tractor beam down , or this is gonna be a short trip .
We 're coming up on their sentry ships .
Hold them off . Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns .
I ca n't believe he 's gone .
There was n't anything you could have done .
Come on , buddy . We 're not out of this yet .
You in , kid ? Okay , stay sharp .
Here they come .
They 're coming in too fast !
We 've lost the lateral controls . Do n't worry . She 'll hold together .
Hear me , baby ? Hold together .
Got him . I got him !
Great , kid . Do n't get cocky .
There 's still two more .
That 's it . We did it . We did it .
Help . I think I 'm melting . This is all your fault .
Are they away ?
They 've just made the jump into hyperspace .
You 're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship ?
I 'm taking an awful risk , Vader .
This had better work .
Not a bad bit of rescuing , huh ? You know , sometimes I amaze even myself .
That does n't sound too hard .
They let us go . It 's the only explanation for the ease of our escape .
You call that easy ? They 're tracking us .
Not this ship , sister .
At least the information in R2 is still intact .
What 's so important ? What 's he carrying ?
The technical readouts of that battle station .
I only hope that when the data 's analysed a weakness can be found .
It 's not over yet . It is for me , sister .
I ai n't in this for your revolution , and I 'm not in it for you , Princess .
I expect to be well paid . I 'm in it for the money .
You need n't worry about your reward .
If money is all that you love , then that 's what you 'll receive .
Your friend is quite a mercenary .
I wonder if he really cares about anything ... or anybody .
I care .
So what do you think of her , Han ?
I 'm trying not to , kid .
Good .
Still , she 's got a lot of spirit .
What do you think ? You think a princess and a guy like me --
No .
You 're safe . When we heard about Alderaan , we feared the worst .
We have no time for sorrows , Commander .
You must use the information in this R2 unit to help plan the attack .
It 's our only hope .
Yes . We 're approaching the planet Yavin .
The rebel base is on a moon on the far side .
We are preparing to orbit the planet .
The battle station is heavily shielded ...
and carries a firepower greater than half the starfleet .
Its defences are designed around a direct large - scale assault .
A small , one - man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defence .
Pardon me for asking , sir , but what good are snub fighters against that ?
The Empire does n't consider a small , one - man fighter to be any threat ...
or they 'd have a tighter defence .
An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia ...
has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station .
The approach will not be easy .
You 're required to manoeuvre straight down this trench ...
and skim the surface to this point .
The target area is only two metres wide .
It 's a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port .
The shaft leads directly to the reactor system .
A precise hit will start a chain reaction ...
which should destroy the station .
Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction .
The shaft is ray - shielded , so you 'll have to use proton torpedoes .
That 's impossible , even for a computer .
No , it 's not . I used to bull 's - eye womp rats in my T - 16 back home .
They 're not much bigger than two metres .
Then man your ships , and may the Force be with you .
Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity .
The moon with the rebel base will be in range in 30 minutes .
This will be a day long remembered .
It has seen the end of Kenobi and will soon see the end of the rebellion .
All flight crews , man your stations .
So , you got your reward and you 're just leaving , then ?
That 's right . Yeah .
I got some old debts I gotta pay off with this stuff .
Even if I did n't , you do n't think I 'd be fool enough to stick around here , do ya ?
Why do n't you come with us ? You 're pretty good in a fight . We could use ya .
Come on . Why do n't you take a look around ?
You know what 's about to happen , what they 're up against .
They could use a good pilot like you . You 're turning your back on them .
What good 's a reward if you ai n't around to use it ?
Besides , attacking that battle station ai n't my idea of courage .
It 's more like ... suicide .
All right . Well , take care of yourself , Han .
I guess that 's what you 're best at , is n't it ?
Hey , Luke .
May the Force be with you .
What are you looking at ? I know what I 'm doing .
All pilots to your stations .
What 's wrong ? It 's Han .
He 's got to follow his own path . No one can choose it for him .
I only wish Ben were here .
Open main launch tubes .
Main launch tubes opening , sir .
Hey , Luke !
Biggs ! I do n't believe it . How are ya ?
Coming up ? I 'll be up there with you .
Have I got stories to tell you . Skywalker . Are you sure you can handle this ship ?
Sir , Luke is the best bush pilot in the outer - rim territories .
You 'll do all right . Thank you , sir . I 'll try .
Gotta get aboard . We 'll hear all your stories when we get back , all right ?
Hey , Biggs . I told you I 'd make it someday .
It 'll be like old times , Luke . They 'll never stop us .
This R2 unit of yours seems a bit beat up . You want a new one ?
Not on your life . That droid and I have been through a lot .
You okay , R2 ?
Good .
Gold squadron , begin take - off procedure .
Hang on tight , R2 . You 've got to come back .
You would n't want my life to get boring , would you ?
Luke , the Force will be with you .
Standby alert . Death Star approaching .
Estimated time to firing range , 15 minutes .
All wings report in . Red 10 standing by .
Red Seven standing by . Red Three standing by .
Red Six standing by . Red Nine standing by .
Red Two standing by . Red 11 standing by .
Red Five standing by .
Lock S - foils in attack position .
We 're passing through the magnetic field .
Hold tight . Switch your deflectors on .
Double front .
Look at the size of that thing .
Cut the chatter , Red Two . Accelerate to attack speed .
This is it , boys . Red Leader , this is Gold Leader .
I copy , Gold Leader . We 're starting for the target shaft .
We 're in position . I 'm going to cut across the axis and draw their fire .
Heavy fire , boss , 23 degrees . I see it . Stay low .
This is Red Five . I 'm going in .
Luke , pull up !
You all right ? A little cooked , but I 'm okay .
We count 30 rebel ships , but they 're so small they 're evading our turbolasers .
We 'll have to destroy them ship to ship . Get the crews to their fighters .
Watch yourself .
There 's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower . I 'm on it .
I 'm going in . Cover me , Porkins . Right with you , Red Three .
I 've got a problem here .
Eject . I can hold it .
Pull up ! No , I 'm all right --
The rebel base will be in firing range in seven minutes .
Luke , trust your feelings .
Squad leaders ...
we 've picked up a new group of signals . Enemy fighters coming your way .
My scope 's negative . I do n't see anything .
Pick up your visual scanning . Here they come .
You 've got one on your tail .
I 'm hit !
You 've picked one up . Watch it . I ca n't see it .
He 's on me tight . I ca n't shake him .
I 'll be right there .
Several fighters have broken off from the main group . Come with me .
Fall in . Fall in . Watch your back , Luke .
Fighters above you , coming in .
I 'm hit , but not bad . R2 , see what you can do with it .
Hang on back there .
Red Six , can you see Red Five ?
There 's a heavy fire zone . Red Five , where are you ?
I ca n't shake him .
I 'm on him , Luke .
Blast it , Biggs . Where are you ?
Thanks , Wedge . Good shooting , Wedge .
Red Leader , this is Gold Leader . We 're starting our attack run .
I copy , Gold Leader . Move into position .
Stay in attack formation .
The exhaust port is marked and locked in .
Switch all power to front deflector screen .
Switch all power to front deflector screen .
How many guns do you think , Gold Five ?
Say about 20 guns , some on the surface , some on the towers .
Death Star will be in range in five minutes .
Switch to targeting computer .
Computer 's locked . Getting a signal .
The guns . They 've stopped .
Stabilize your rear deflectors . Watch for enemy fighters .
They 're coming in . Three marks at 210 .
I 'll take them myself . Cover me .
Yes , sir .
It 's no good . I ca n't manoeuvre . Stay on target .
We 're too close . Stay on target .
Loosen up !
Gold Five to Red Leader , lost Tiree , lost Hutch .
I copy , Gold Leader . They came from behind .
We 've analysed their attack , sir , and there is a danger .
Should I have your ship standing by ?
Evacuate ? In our moment of triumph ?
I think you overestimate their chances .
Rebel base , three minutes and closing .
Red boys , this is Red Leader .
Rendezvous at mark 6 . 1 .
This is Red Two flying toward you . Red Three standing by .
Red Leader , this is Base One .
Keep half your group out of range for the next run .
Copy , Base One . Luke , take Red Two and Three .
Hold up here and wait for my signal to start your run .
This is it .
We should be able to see it by now .
Keep your eyes open for those fighters .
There 's too much interference . Red Five , can you see them ?
No sign of any -- Wait . Coming in . 35 . I see them .
I 'm in range .
Target 's coming up .
Just hold them off for a few seconds .
Close up formation .
Almost there .
Let her loose . They 're right behind me . Almost there .
I ca n't hold them .
It 's away !
It 's a hit ! Negative .
Negative . It did n't go in .
It just impacted on the surface .
Red Leader , we 're right above you .
Turn to . 05 . We 'll cover for you .
Stay there . I just lost my starboard engine .
Get set up for your attack run .
Rebel base , one minute and closing .
Biggs , Wedge , let 's close it up .
We 're going in full throttle . That ought to keep those fighters off our back .
Right with you , boss .
Luke , at that speed , will you be able to pull out in time ?
It 'll be just like Beggars Canyon back home .
We 'll stay back far enough to cover you .
My scope shows the tower , but I ca n't see the exhaust port .
Are you sure the computer can hit it ?
Watch yourself . Increase speed , full throttle .
What about that tower ?
You worry about those fighters . I 'll worry about the tower .
R2 , that stabilizer 's broken loose again . See if you ca n't lock it down .
Fighters coming in . 3 .
I 'm hit . I ca n't stay with you . Get clear , Wedge .
You ca n't do any more good back there . Sorry .
Let him go . Stay on the leader .
Hurry , Luke . They 're coming in much faster this time .
R2 , try and increase the power .
Hurry up , Luke . Quick .
Quick .
Rebel base , 30 seconds and closing .
I 'm on the leader .
Hang on , R2 .
Use the Force , Luke .
Let go , Luke .
The Force is strong with this one .
Luke , trust me .
His computer 's off .
You switched off your targeting computer . What 's wrong ?
Nothing . I 'm all right .
I 've lost R2 .
The Death Star has cleared the planet .
The Death Star has cleared the planet .
Rebel base in range .
You may fire when ready . Commence primary ignition .
I have you now .
What ?
Look out .
You 're all clear , kid . Now let 's blow this thing and go home .
Stand by .
Stand by .
Great shot , kid ! That was one in a million !
Remember , the Force will be with you always .
I just knew you 'd come back .
I was n't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward .
I knew there was more to you than money .
Oh , no .
Oh , my . R2 , can you hear me ?
Say something . You can repair him , ca n't you ?
We 'll get to work on him right away . You must repair him .
Sir , if any of my circuits or gears will help , I 'll gladly donate them .
He 'll be all right .
Echo Three to Echo Seven .
Han , old buddy , do you read me ?
Loud and clear , kid . What 's up ?
I finished my circle . I do n't pick up any life readings .
There is n't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser .
The sensors are placed . I 'm going back .
Right . I 'll see you shortly .
There 's a meteorite that hit the ground near here .
I want to check it out . It wo n't take long .
Steady . Steady , girl . What 's the matter ? You smell something ?
Chewie . Chewie ?
All right . Do n't lose your temper .
I 'll come right back and give you a hand .
Solo .
No sign of life out there , General . The sensors are in place .
You 'll know if anything comes around . Commander Skywalker reported in yet ?
No . He 's checking out a meteorite that hit near him .
With all the meteor activity , it 's gonna be difficult to spot approaching ships .
General , I gotta leave . I ca n't stay any more .
I 'm sorry to hear that . There 's a price on my head .
If I do n't pay off Jabba the Hutt , I 'm a dead man .
A death mark 's not an easy thing to live with .
You 're a good fighter , Solo . I hate to lose you .
Thank you , General .
Well , Your Highness , guess this is it .
That 's right .
Do n't get all mushy on me . So long , Princess .
Han .
Yes , Your Highnessness . I thought you had decided to stay .
The bounty hunter we ran into in Ord Mantell changed my mind .
Han , we need you .
We need ? Yes .
What about you need ? I need ?
I do n't know what you 're talking about .
You probably do n't . What precisely am I supposed to know ?
Come on . You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me .
Yes . You 're a great help to us . You 're a natural leader .
No . That 's not it .
Come on .
Come on . You 're imagining things .
Am I ? Then why are you following me ?
Afraid I 'd leave without giving you a goodbye kiss ?
I 'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee . I can arrange that .
You could use a good kiss !
Do n't blame me . I did n't ask you to turn on the thermal heater .
I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess 's chamber .
It 's supposed to be freezing .
How we 're going to dry her clothes I really do n't know .
Oh , switch off !
Why did you take this apart now ? I 'm trying to get us out of here .
Excuse me . Put them back together right now .
Might I have a word ? What do you want ?
Princess Leia 's been trying to get you on the communicator .
I turned it off . I do n't want to talk to her .
Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke . He has n't come back .
She does n't know where he is . I do n't know where he is .
Nobody knows where he is . What do you mean , nobody knows ?
Deck Officer .
Deck Officer . Excuse me , sir . Might I -
Do you know where Commander Skywalker is ?
I have n't seen him . It 's possible he came in the south entrance .
It 's possible ? Why do n't you go find out ?
It 's getting dark out there . Yes , sir .
Excuse me , sir . Might I enquire what 's going on ?
Why not ? Impossible man .
Come along , R2 . Let 's find Princess Leia .
Between ourselves , I think Master Luke is in considerable danger .
Commander Skywalker has n't come in the south entrance .
Maybe he forgot to check in . Not likely . Are the speeders ready ?
Not yet . We 're having trouble adapting them to the cold .
We 'll have to go out on tauntauns . The temperature 's dropping too rapidly .
That 's right , and my friend 's out in it .
Your tauntaun will freeze before you reach the first marker .
Then I 'll see you in hell .
You must come along now , R2 .
There 's really nothing more we can do .
And my joints are freezing up .
Do n't say things like that . Of course we 'll see Master Luke again .
And he 'll be quite all right . You 'll see .
Stupid little short circuit . He 'll be quite all right .
Sir , all the patrols are in . Still no -
Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo .
Mistress Leia , R2 says he 's been quite unable to pick up any signals ...
although he admits that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope .
Your Highness , there 's nothing more we can do tonight .
The shield doors must be closed .
Close the doors . Yes , sir .
R2 says the chances of survival are 725 - to - 1 .
Actually , R2 has been known to make mistakes ...
from time to time .
Oh , dear . Oh , dear .
Do n't worry about Master Luke . I 'm sure he 'll be all right .
He 's quite clever , you know , for a human being .
Luke .
Luke .
Ben ?
You will go to the Dagobah system .
Dagobah system ?
There you will learn from Yoda ...
the Jedi master who instructed me .
Do n't do this , Luke . Give me a sign here .
Not much time . Ben .
Hang on , kid .
Dagobah system . Dagobah .
This may smell bad , kid ...
Yoda .
but it 'll keep you warm till I get the shelter up .
I thought they smelled bad ...
on the outside .
Echo Base , I 've got something .
Not much , but it could be a life form .
Commander Skywalker , do you copy ?
This is Rogue Two .
This is Rogue Two .
Captain Solo , do you copy ?
Commander Skywalker , do you copy ?
This is Rogue Two .
Good morning . Nice of you guys to drop by .
Echo Base , this is Rogue Two .
I 've found them . Repeat . I 've found them .
Master Luke , sir , it 's so good to see you fully functional again .
Thanks , 3PO . R2 expresses his relief also .
How ya feelin ' , kid ? You do n't look so bad to me .
You look strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark .
Thanks to you . That 's two you owe me , junior .
Well , Your Worship looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer .
I had nothing to do with it .
General Rieekan thinks it 's dangerous for any ships to leave ...
until we 've activated the energy field .
That 's a good story .
I think you just ca n't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight .
I do n't know where you get your delusions , laser brain .
Laugh it up , fuzzball ...
but you did n't see us alone in the south passage .
She expressed her true feelings for me .
My -
Why , you stuck - up , half - witted ...
scruffy - looking nerf herder !
Who 's scruffy - lookin ' ?
I must have hit close to the mark to get her riled up like that , huh , kid ?
I guess you do n't know everything about women yet .
Headquarters personnel , report to command centre .
Headquarters personnel , report to command centre .
Take it easy .
Excuse us , please .
Princess , we have a visitor .
We picked up something outside Zone 12 moving east .
It 's metal . It could n't be one of those creatures .
Could be one of our speeders . No . Wait .
There 's something very weak coming through .
Sir , I am fluent in six million forms of communication .
This signal is not used by the Alliance . It could be an imperial code .
It is n't friendly . Chewie , let 's check it out .
Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38 .
I 'm afraid there 's not much left . What was it ?
Droid of some kind . I did n't hit it that hard .
Must have had a self - destruct . An imperial probe droid .
It 's a good bet the Empire knows we 're here .
We 'd better start the evacuation . Admiral . Yes , Captain ?
I think we 've got something , sir . The report is only a fragment ...
from a probe droid in the Hoth system , but it 's the best lead we 've had .
We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy .
I want proof , not leads . The visuals indicate life readings .
It could mean anything . If we followed up every lead -
But , sir , the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of humans forms .
You found something ? Yes , my lord .
That 's it . The rebels are there .
My lord , there are so many uncharted settlements .
It could be smugglers - That is the system .
And I 'm sure Skywalker is with them .
Set your course for the Hoth system .
General Veers , prepare your men .
Admiral .
Groups Seven and 10 will stay behind to fly the speeders .
As soon as each transport is loaded ...
evacuation control will give clearance for launch .
Right , sir .
All right . That 's it .
Try it .
Turn it off ! Turn it off !
Sir , it will take quite a while to evacuate the T - 47 s .
Forget the heavy equipment . There 's time to get small modules on the transports .
Take care , sir . Thanks .
Chewie , take care of yourself , okay ?
Hi , kid .
There 's gotta be a reason for it . Check it at the other end .
Wait a second .
Are you all right ? Yeah .
Be careful .
You too .
General , there 's a fleet of Stardestroyers ...
Reroute all power to the energy shield .
We gotta hold them till all transports are away .
Prepare for ground assault .
What is it , General ? The fleet has moved out of light speed .
ComScan has detected an energy field ...
protecting an area of the sixth planet of the Hoth system .
The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment .
The rebels are alerted to our presence .
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed too close to the system .
He felt surprise was wiser .
He is as clumsy as he is stupid .
General , prepare your troops for a surface attack .
Yes , my lord .
Lord Vader .
The fleet has moved out of light speed , and we 're preparing to -
You have failed me for the last time , Admiral .
Captain Piett . Yes , my lord ?
Make ready to land our troops beyond their energy field ...
and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off the system .
You are in command now , Admiral Piett .
Thank you , Lord Vader .
All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance .
The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they 're loaded .
Only two fighter escorts per ship .
The energy shield can only be opened for a short time ...
so you 'll have to stay very close to your transports .
Two fighters against a Stardestroyer ?
The ion cannon will fire several shots ...
to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path .
When you 've gotten past the energy shield ...
proceed directly to the rendezvous point . Understood ?
Good luck .
Everybody to your stations . Let 's go .
Their primary target will be the power generators .
Prepare to open shield .
Sir , rebel ships are coming into our sector .
Good . Our first catch of the day .
Stand by , ion control .
Fire .
The first transport is away .
The first transport is away .
Feeling all right , sir ?
Just like new , Dak . How about you ?
Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself .
I know what you mean .
Echo Station 3 - T8 . We 've spotted imperial walkers .
Imperial walkers on the north ridge .
Echo Station 57 , we 're on our way .
All right , boys , keep tight now .
Luke , I have no approach vector . I 'm not set .
Steady , Dak .
Attack pattern Delta . Go now .
I 'm coming in .
Hobbie , you still with me ?
That armour 's too strong for blasters .
Rogue Group , use your harpoons and tow cables .
Go for the legs . It might be our only chance .
Stand by , Dak .
Luke , we 've got a malfunction in fire control .
I 'll have to cut in the auxiliary .
Just hang on .
Hang on , Dak . Get ready to fire that tow cable .
Dak ?
Yes , Lord Vader . I 've reached the main power generators .
The shield will be down in moments . You may start your landing .
Rogue Three .
Copy , Rogue Leader .
Wedge , I 've lost my gunner . You 'll have to make this shot .
I 'll cover for you .
Set your harpoon . Follow me on the next pass .
Coming around , Rogue Leader .
Steady , Rogue Two .
Activate harpoon .
Good shot , Janson .
One more pass .
Cable out . Let her go !
Detach cable .
Cable detached .
Come on !
That got him ! I see it , Wedge . Good work .
I do n't think we can protect two transports at a time .
It 's risky , but we ca n't hold out much longer . We have no choice .
Launch patrol . Evacuate remaining ground staff .
This one goes there , that one goes there . Right ?
R2 , you take good care of Master Luke now , understand ?
And do take good care of yourself .
Oh , dear . Oh , dear .
All troops will debark for ground assault . Prepare to target the main generator .
Rogue Two , are you all right ? Yeah . I 'm with you , Rogue Leader .
Set harpoon . I 'll cover for you .
Coming around . Watch that crossfire , boys .
Set for position three .
Steady .
Stay tight and low . This is it !
Hobbie !
I 've been hit !
You all right ? Why are you still here ?
Heard the command centre had been hit . You 've got your clearance to leave .
Do n't worry . I 'll leave . First I 'm gonna get you to your ship .
Your Highness , we must take this last transport . It 's our only hope .
Send all troops in Sector 12 to the south slope to protect the fighters .
Imperial troops have entered the base . Imperial troops have entered -
Come on . That 's it .
Give the evacuation code signal .
And get to your transports .
Begin retreat ! Fall back !
Distance to power generators ? 17 . 28 .
Target . Maximum firepower .
Transport , this is Solo . Take off . I ca n't get to you .
I 'll get her out on the Falcon . Come on .
Where are you going ? Come back !
Wait ! Wait for me ! Stop !
How typical . Come on .
Hurry up , goldenrod ! You 're gonna be a permanent resident .
Wait ! Wait !
How 's this ? Would it help if I got out and pushed ?
Captain Solo . Captain Solo . It might .
Sir , might I suggest that you -
It can wait .
This bucket of bolts will never get past that blockade .
This baby 's got a few surprises left in her .
Come on ! Come on !
Switch over . Let 's hope we do n't have a burnout .
See ?
Someday you 'll be wrong . I hope I 'm there to see it .
Punch it !
R2 . Get her ready for take - off .
Good luck , Luke . See you at the rendezvous .
Do n't worry , R2 . We 're going . We 're going .
There 's nothing wrong , R2 . I 'm just setting a new course .
We 're not gonna regroup with the others . We 're going to the Dagobah system .
Yes , R2 .
That 's all right . I 'd like to keep it on manual control for a while .
I saw ' em ! I saw ' em ! Saw what ?
Stardestroyers , two of ' em coming right at us .
Sir , might I suggest - Shut him up or shut him down !
Check the deflector shield .
Great . Well , we can still outmanoeuvre them .
Take evasive action !
Prepare to jump to light speed . But , sir !
They 're getting closer .
Oh , yeah ? Watch this .
Watch what ?
I think we 're in trouble . If I may say so ...
It 's impossible to go to light speed . We 're in trouble .
Horizontal boosters !
Alluvial dampers .
That 's not it . Bring me the hydrospanner .
I do n't know how we 're gonna get out of this one .
Chewie !
That was n't a laser blast . Something hit us .
Han , get up here .
Come on , Chewie !
Asteroids .
Chewie , set 271 . What are you doing ?
You 're not actually going into an asteroid field ?
They 'd be crazy to follow us , would n't they ?
You do n't have to do this to impress me .
Sir , the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field ...
is approximately 3 , 720 - to - 1 . Never tell me the odds .
You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake . This could be it .
I take it back .
We 're gonna get pulverized if we stay out here much longer .
Ai n't gonna argue with that . Pulverized ?
I 'm going closer to one of the big ones .
Closer ? Closer ?
This is suicide ! There 's nowhere to go .
There . That looks pretty good .
What looks pretty good ?
Yeah . That 'll do nicely .
Excuse me , ma ' am , but where are we going ?
I hope you know what you 're doing .
Yeah . Me too .
Yep , that 's it . Dagobah .
No , I 'm not gonna change my mind about this .
I 'm not picking up any cities or technology .
Massive life form readings though .
There 's something alive down there .
Yes . I 'm sure it 's perfectly safe for droids .
I know ! I know ! All the scopes are dead . I ca n't see a thing .
Just hang on . I 'm gonna start the landing cycle .
No , R2 , you stay put . I 'll have a look around .
R2 ?
Where are you ?
R2 !
You be more careful .
R2 , that way .
R2 !
Oh , no .
Are you all right ? Come on .
You were lucky to get out of there .
Anything broken ?
If you 're saying coming here was a bad idea I 'm beginning to agree with ya .
R2 , what are we doing here ?
It 's like ...
something out of a dream or -
I do n't know . Maybe I 'm just going crazy .
Yes , Admiral ?
Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon , lord ...
but it has entered an asteroid field , and we cannot risk -
Asteroids do not concern me , Admiral .
I want that ship , not excuses . Yes , lord .
I 'm gonna shut down everything but the emergency power systems .
Sir , I 'm almost afraid to ask , but does that include shutting me down too ?
No . I need you to talk to the Falcon find out what 's wrong with the hyperdrive .
Sir , it 's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable .
Not entirely stable ? I 'm glad you 're here to tell us these things .
Chewie , take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive .
Sometimes I just do n't understand human behaviour .
After all , I 'm only trying to do my job .
Let go .
Let go , please . Do n't get excited .
Captain , being held by you is n't quite enough to get me excited .
Sorry , sweetheart . I have n't got time for anything else .
Ready for some power ? Okay .
Let 's see now .
Put that in there . There you go .
Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda ...
if he even exists .
It 's really a strange place to find a Jedi master .
This place gives me the creeps .
Still there 's something familiar about this place .
I do n't know . I feel like - Feel like what ?
Like we 're being watched .
Away put your weapon . I mean you no harm .
I am wondering , why are you here ?
I 'm looking for someone . Looking ?
Right .
Help you I can . Yes .
I do n't think so .
I 'm looking for a great warrior .
Wars not make one great .
Put that down . Hey ! That 's my dinner .
How you get so big eating food of this kind ?
Listen , friend , we did n't mean to land in that puddle .
If we could get our ship out , we would . But we ca n't .
Aw , cannot get your ship out .
Get out of there .
Hey , you could have broken this .
Do n't do that .
You 're making a mess .
Hey , give me that .
Mine , or I will help you not .
I do n't want your help . I want my lamp back .
I 'm gonna need it to get out of this slimy mud - hole .
Mud - hole ? Slimy ? My home this is .
R2 , let him have it .
Mine ! Mine ! Mine ! R2 .
Will you move along , little fella ? We got a lot of work to do .
Stay and help you I will . Find your friend .
I 'm not looking for a friend . I 'm looking for a Jedi master .
Jedi master . Yoda .
You seek Yoda . You know him ?
Take you to him I will .
Yes , yes , but now we must eat .
Come . Good food . Come .
Come , come .
R2 ...
stay and watch after the camp .
Where is R2 when I need him ?
Sir , I do n't know where your ship learned to communicate but it has the most peculiar dialect .
I believe it says the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized .
I 'm afraid you 'll have to replace it .
Well , of course I 'll have to replace it .
Here . And , Chewie ...
I think we better replace the negative power coupling .
Hey , Your Worship , I 'm only trying to help .
Would you please stop calling me that ?
Sure , Leia .
You make it so difficult sometimes . I do . I really do .
You could be a little nicer though .
Admit it . Sometimes you think I 'm all right .
Occasionally , maybe when you are n't acting like a scoundrel .
Scoundrel ?
I like the sound of that .
Stop that . Stop what ?
Stop that . My hands are dirty .
My hands are dirty too . What are you afraid of ?
Afraid ? You 're trembling .
I 'm not trembling .
You like me because I 'm a scoundrel .
There are n't enough scoundrels in your life .
I happen to like nice men .
I 'm a nice man . No , you 're not .
Sir , sir !
I 've isolated the reverse power flux coupling .
Thank you . Thank you very much . You 're perfectly welcome , sir .
That , Lord Vader , was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes .
Considering the damage we 've sustained , they must have been destroyed .
No , Captain , they 're alive .
I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found .
Lord Vader . Yes , Admiral . What is it ?
The emperor commands you to make contact with him .
Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission .
Yes , my lord .
What is thy bidding , my master ?
There is a great disturbance in the Force .
I have felt it .
We have a new enemy -
the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star .
I have no doubt this boy ...
is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker .
How is that possible ?
Search your feelings , Lord Vader .
You will know it to be true .
He could destroy us .
He 's just a boy . Obi - Wan can no longer help him .
The Force is strong with him .
The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi .
If he could be turned he would become a powerful ally .
Yes .
He would be a great asset .
Can it be done ?
He will join us or die , master .
I 'm sure it 's delicious . I just do n't understand why we ca n't see Yoda now .
Patience . For the Jedi , it is time to eat as well .
Eat . Eat .
Hot .
Good food . Good .
How far away is Yoda ? Will it take us long to get there ?
Not far . Yoda not far .
Patience . Soon you will be with him .
Root leaf . I cook .
Why wish you become Jedi ?
Mostly ' cause of my father , I guess .
Father . Powerful Jedi was he .
Powerful Jedi . Oh , come on .
How could you know my father ? You do n't even know who I am .
I do n't even know what I 'm doing here . We 're wasting our time !
I cannot teach him . The boy has no patience .
He will learn patience .
Much anger in him like his father .
Was I any different when you taught me ?
No . He is not ready . Yoda .
I am ready .
I can be a Jedi . Ben , tell him I 'm -
Ready , are you ? What know you ready ?
For 800 years have I trained Jedi .
My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained .
AJedi must have the deepest commitment ...
the most serious mind .
This one a long time have I watched .
All his life has he looked away to the future , to the horizon .
Never his mind on where he was ...
what he was doing .
Adventure . Excitement .
AJedi craves not these things .
You are reckless .
So was I , if you remember .
He is too old .
Yes , too old to begin the training .
But I 've learned so much .
Will he finish what he begins ? I wo n't fail you .
I 'm not afraid .
You will be .
You will be .
Sir , if I may venture an opinion - I 'm not interested in your opinion .
There 's something out there .
Where ? Outside in the cave .
There it is . Listen !
I 'm going out there . Are you crazy ?
I just got this bucket together . I wo n't let it get torn apart .
Then I 'm going with you .
I think it might be better if I stay behind and guard the ship .
Oh , no .
This ground sure feels strange .
It does n't feel like rock .
There 's an awful lot of moisture in here .
I do n't know . I have a bad feeling about this .
Yeah .
Watch out !
It 's all right . It 's all right .
Yeah , that 's what I thought - mynock .
Chewie , check the rest of the ship and make sure there are no more attached ...
chewing on the power cables .
Mynocks ?
Go inside . We 'll clean them off if there are any more .
Go away ! Go away , beastly thing ! Shoo !
Wait a minute .
Chewie , let 's get out of here ! The Empire is still out there !
No time to discuss this in committee !
I am not a committee !
You ca n't make the jump to light speed in this asteroid field .
Sit down , sweetheart . We 're taking off .
Look ! I see it .
We 're doomed ! The cave is collapsing .
This is no cave . What ?
Yes , run .
Yes . AJedi 's strength flows from the Force .
But beware of the dark side . Anger , fear , aggression -
The dark side of the Force are they .
Easily they flow , quick to join you in a fight .
If once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny .
Consume you it will , as it did Obi - Wan 's apprentice .
Vader .
Is the dark side stronger ? No , no .
How am I to know the good side from the bad ?
You will know ...
when you are calm , at peace passive .
AJedi uses the Force for knowledge and defence ...
never for attack .
But tell me why I ca n't - No . There is no why .
Nothing more will I teach you today .
Clear your mind of questions .
There 's something not right here .
I feel cold .
Death . That place ...
is strong with the dark side of the Force .
A domain of evil it is .
In you must go .
What 's in there ?
Only what you take with you .
Your weapons ...
you will not need them .
Bounty hunters . We do n't need their scum .
Yes , sir . Those rebels wo n't escape us .
Sir , we have a priority signal from the Stardestroyer Avenger .
Right .
There will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon .
You are free to use any methods necessary ...
but I want them alive .
No disintegrations .
As you wish . Lord Vader .
My lord , we have them .
Thank goodness we 're coming out of the asteroid field .
Let 's get out of here . Ready for light speed ?
One , two ...
three !
It 's not fair .
Transfer circuits are n't working . It 's not my fault . No light speed ? It 's not my fault .
Sir , we just lost the main rear deflector shield .
One more direct hit on the back quarter and we 're done for .
Turn her around .
Turn her around ! I 'm gonna put all power in the front shield .
You 're gonna attack ? The odds of surviving ...
a direct assault on an imperial Stardestroyer - / Shut up !
They 're moving to attack position .
Shields up .
Track them . They may come around for another pass .
Captain Needa , the ship no longer appears on our scopes .
They ca n't have disappeared . No ship that small has a cloaking device .
There 's no trace of them . Captain , Lord Vader demands an update .
Get a shuttle ready .
I shall assume full responsibility for losing them and apologize to Lord Vader .
Meanwhile , continue to scan the area . Yes , Captain Needa .
Use the Force . Yes .
Now , the stone .
Feel it .
Concentrate !
Oh , no . We 'll never get it out now .
So certain are you .
Always with you it cannot be done .
Hear you nothing that I say ?
Master , moving stones around is one thing . This is totally different .
No . No different . Only different in your mind .
You must unlearn what you have learned .
All right . I 'll give it a try . Try not .
Do ...
or do not . There is no try .
I ca n't . It 's too big .
Size matters not .
Look at me . Judge me by my size , do you ?
And well you should not ...
for my ally is the Force .
And a powerful ally it is .
Life creates it ...
makes it grow .
Its energy surrounds us ...
and binds us .
Luminous beings are we , not this crude matter .
You must feel the Force around you .
Here , between you , me ...
the tree , the rock -
everywhere .
Yes even between the land and the ship .
You want the impossible .
I do n't believe it .
That is why you fail .
Apology accepted , Captain Needa .
Lord Vader , our ships have completed their scan and found nothing .
If the Millennium Falcon went into light speed it 'll be on the other side of the galaxy now .
Alert all commands .
Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory .
Yes , my lord . We 'll find them . Do n't fail me again ...
Admiral .
Alert all commands . Deploy the fleet .
Captain Solo , this time you have gone too far .
I will not be quiet , Chewbacca . Why does n't anyone listen to me ?
The fleet 's beginning to break up .
I really do n't see how that 's going to help .
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances .
The Empire may be gracious enough -
Thank you . What did you have in mind next ?
If they follow standard imperial procedure they 'll dump their garbage before they go to light speed .
Then we just float away . With the rest of the garbage .
Then what ? Then we gotta find a safe port somewhere around here .
Any ideas ?
Where are we ? The Anoat system .
The Anoat system . There 's not much there .
Oh , wait . This is interesting .
Lando . Lando system ?
Lando 's not a system . He 's a man . Lando Calrissian .
Card player , gambler .
A scoundrel . You 'd like him . Thanks .
Bespin . It 's pretty far , but I think we can make it .
A mining colony ? Yeah , a tibanna gas mine .
Lando conned somebody out of it .
We go back a long way , Lando and me .
Can you trust him ? No .
Here we go , Chewie . Stand by . Detach .
You do have your moments .
Not many of them , but you do have them .
Concentrate .
Feel the Force flow .
Yes .
Good .
Calm . Yes .
Through the Force , things you will see .
Other places . The future . The past .
Old friends long gone .
Control , control .
You must learn control .
I saw a city in the clouds .
Friends you have there .
They were in pain . It is the future you see .
Future ?
Will they die ?
Difficult to see .
Always in motion is the future .
I 've gotta go to them .
Decide you must how to serve them best .
If you leave now , help them you could but you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered .
No , I do n't have a landing permit .
I 'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian .
Wait a minute ! Let me explain !
You will not deviate from your present course .
Rather touchy , are n't they ? I thought you knew this person .
That was a long time ago . I 'm sure he 's forgotten about that .
Permission granted to land on Platform 327 .
Thank you .
Nothing to worry about . We go way back , Lando and me .
Who 's worried ?
No one to meet us .
I do n't like this .
What would you like ? They did let us land .
Look , do n't worry . Everything 's gonna be fine . Trust me .
See ? My friend .
Keep your eyes open .
Hey . Why , you slimy , double - crossing , no - good swindler .
You 've got a lot of guts coming here , after what you pulled .
How you doin ' , you old pirate ? So good to see you !
I never thought I 'd see you again . Well , he seems very friendly .
Yes . Very friendly .
What are you doing here ?
Repairs . I thought you could help me out .
What have you done to my ship ? Your ship ?
How you doin ' , Chewbacca ?
Still hanging around with this loser ?
Hello . What have we here ?
Welcome . I 'm Lando Calrissian . I 'm the administrator of this facility .
And who might you be ? Leia .
Welcome , Leia .
All right , all right . You old smoothie .
Hello , sir . I am C - 3PO , human - cyborg relations .
My facilities are at your - Well , really !
What 's wrong with the Falcon ? Hyperdrive .
I 'll get my people to work on her . Good .
That ship saved my life quite a few times . She 's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy .
How 's the gas mine ? Still paying off for you ?
Not as well as I 'd like . We 're a small outpost and not very self - sufficient .
I 've had supply problems of every kind .
I 've had labour difficulties .
What 's so funny ? You . Listen to you .
You sound like a businessman , a responsible leader .
Who 'd have thought that , huh ?
Seeing you sure brings back a few things . Yeah .
Yeah , I 'm responsible these days .
It 's the price you pay for being successful .
Nice to see a familiar face .
How rude !
That sounds like an R2 unit in there . I wonder if - Hello ?
How interesting .
Who are you ? Oh , my . I 'm terribly sorry .
I did n't mean to intrude . Please do n't get up .
Luke , you must complete the training .
I ca n't keep the vision out of my head . I 've gotta help them .
You must not go .
But Han and Leia will die if I do n't . You do n't know that .
Even Yoda cannot see their fate .
But I can help them . I feel the Force .
But you cannot control it .
This is a dangerous time for you when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force .
Yes , yes . To Obi - Wan you listen .
The cave . Remember your failure at the cave .
But I 've learned so much since then .
Master Yoda , I promise to return and finish what I 've begun .
You have my word . It is you and your abilities the emperor wants .
That is why your friends are made to suffer .
That 's why I have to go .
Luke , I do n't want to lose you to the emperor the way I lost Vader .
You wo n't .
Stopped they must be . On this all depends .
Only a fully trained Jedi knight , with the Force as his ally ...
will conquer Vader and his emperor .
If you end your training now ...
if you choose the quick and easy path , as Vader did ...
you will become an agent of evil .
Patience .
And sacrifice Han and Leia ? If you honour what they fight for ...
If you choose to face Vader , you will do it alone .
I cannot interfere .
I understand .
R2 , fire up the converters .
Do n't give in to hate .
That leads to the dark side .
Strong is Vader .
Mind what you have learned . Save you it can .
I will .
And I 'll return . I promise .
Told you , I did . Reckless is he .
Now matters are worse .
That boy is our last hope .
No , there is another .
The ship 's almost finished . Two or three more things and we 're in great shape .
The sooner the better . Something 's wrong here .
No one has seen or knows anything about 3PO .
He 's been gone too long to have gotten lost .
Relax .
I 'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out .
I do n't trust Lando .
Well , I do n't trust him either , but he is my friend .
Besides , we 'll soon be gone .
Then you 're as good as gone , are n't you ?
What happened ?
Where ?
Found him in a junk pile ?
What a mess . Chewie , you think you can repair him ?
Lando 's got people that can fix him . No , thanks .
I 'm sorry . Am I interrupting anything ?
Not really .
You look absolutely beautiful .
You truly belong here with us among the clouds .
Thank you .
Would you join me for a little refreshment ?
Everyone 's invited , of course .
Having trouble with your droid ?
No . No problem . Why ?
You see , since we 're a small operation ...
we do n't fall into the jurisdiction of the Empire .
So you 're part of the Mining Guild ? No , not actually .
Our operation is small enough not to be noticed . Which is advantageous for everybody ...
since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves .
Are n't you afraid the Empire 's gonna find out , shut you down ?
It 's been a danger that looms like a shadow over everything we 've built .
But things have developed that 'll ensure security .
I 've just made a deal that 'll keep the Empire out of here forever .
We would be honoured if you would join us .
I had no choice . They arrived right before you did .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm sorry too .
No , 3PO 's with them .
Just hang on . We 're almost there .
I 'm terribly sorry . I did n't mean to intrude .
No , please do n't get up .
Stormtroopers ? Here ? We 're in danger .
I must tell the others . Oh , no ! I 've been shot !
Lord Vader .
You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt ...
after I have Skywalker .
He 's no good to me dead .
He will not be permanently damaged .
Lord Vader , what about Leia and the Wookiee ?
They must never again leave this city .
That was n't part of our agreement , nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter !
Perhaps you think you 're being treated unfairly ?
No .
Good . It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here .
This deal is getting worse all the time .
Oh , yes , that 's very good . I like that .
Something 's not right because now I ca n't see .
That 's much better .
Wait . Wait . Oh , my ! What have you done ?
I 'm backwards !
You flea - bitten furball ! Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough -
I feel terrible .
Why are they doing this ?
They never even asked me any questions .
Get out of here , Lando . Shut up and listen .
Vader 's agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me .
They 'll have to stay here , but they 'll be safe .
And Han ? Vader 's given him to the bounty hunter .
Vader wants us all dead . He does n't want you at all .
He 's after somebody called Skywalker .
Lord Vader set a trap for him . And we 're the bait .
He 's on his way . Perfect .
You fixed us all real good , did n't you ? My friend .
Stop !
I 've done all I can . Sorry I could n't do better , but I got my own problems .
Yeah . You 're a real hero .
You certainly have a way with people .
This facility is crude ...
but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the emperor .
Lord Vader , ship approaching , X - wing class .
Good . Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land .
Lord Vader , we only use this facility for carbon freezing . It might kill him .
I do not want the emperor 's prize damaged .
We will test it on Captain Solo .
If you 'd attached my legs I would n't be in this ridiculous position .
Now remember , Chewbacca , you have a responsibility for me ...
so do n't do anything foolish .
What 's going on , buddy ?
You 're being put into carbon freeze .
What if he does n't survive ? He 's worth a lot to me .
The Empire will compensate you if he dies . Put him in .
Chewbacca , stop !
No , Chewie , stop !
You 're going to get us all killed ! Yes , stop . I 'm not ready to die .
Hey ! Hey ! Listen to me .
Chewie , this wo n't help me .
Hey , save your strength . There 'll be another time .
The princess .
You have to take care of her .
Do you hear me ?
I love you . I know .
What 's going on ? Turn round . I ca n't see .
They 've encased him in carbonite .
He should be quite well - protected ...
if he survived the freezing process , that is .
Well , Calrissian , did he survive ?
Yes , he 's alive .
And in perfect hibernation .
He 's all yours , bounty hunter .
Reset the chamber for Skywalker .
Skywalker has just landed , lord .
Good . See to it that he finds his way in here .
Calrissian take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship .
You said they 'd be left under my supervision .
I am altering the deal . Pray I do n't alter it any further .
Luke , do n't ! It 's a trap !
It 's a trap !
The Force is with you , young Skywalker .
But you are not a Jedi yet .
Well done .
Hold them in the security tower . And keep it quiet . Move .
What do you think you 're doing ? We 're getting out of here .
I knew all along . It had to be a mistake .
Do you think that after what you did to Han -
I had no choice . What are you doing ? Trust him !
We understand , do n't we , Chewie ? He had no choice .
I 'm just trying to help .
We do n't need any of your help .
What ?
It sounds like Han . There 's still a chance to save Han ...
at the east ... platform .
I 'm terribly sorry about all this .
After all , he 's only a Wookiee .
Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold .
R2 , where have you been ?
Wait . Turn around , you woolly -
Hurry ! We 're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter .
Well , at least you 're still in one piece . Look what 's happened to me .
Oh , no ! Chewie , they 're behind you !
You have learned much , young one .
You 'll find I 'm full of surprises .
Your destiny lies with me , Skywalker .
Obi - Wan knew this to be true .
All too easy .
Perhaps you 're not as strong as the emperor thought .
Impressive .
Most impressive .
Obi - Wan has taught you well . You have controlled your fear .
Now , release your anger .
Only your hatred can destroy me .
The security code has been changed .
R2 , you can tell the computer to override the security systems .
R2 , hurry .
Attention . This is Lando Calrissian . Attention .
The Empire has taken control of the city .
I advise everyone to leave before more imperial troops arrive .
This way .
Well , do n't blame me . I 'm an interpreter .
I 'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal .
We 're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Falcon . It 's fixed !
Just open the door , you stupid lump !
I never doubted you for a second . Wonderful !
That hurts ! Bend down , you thoughtless - Ow !
Go !
I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me . Of course I 've looked better .
You are beaten . It is useless to resist .
Do n't let yourself be destroyed as Obi - Wan did .
There is no escape .
Do n't make me destroy you .
You do not yet realize your importance .
You have only begun to discover your power .
Join me and I will complete your training .
With our combined strength ...
we can end this destructive conflict ...
and bring order to the galaxy .
I 'll never join you !
If you only knew the power of the dark side .
Obi - Wan never told you what happened to your father .
He told me enough .
He told me you killed him .
I am your father .
That 's not true .
That 's impossible !
Search your feelings . You know it to be true .
You can destroy the emperor . He has foreseen this .
It is your destiny .
Join me ...
and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son .
Come with me .
It is the only way .
Ben . Ben , please .
Hear me .
We 've got to go back . What ?
I know where Luke is . What about those fighters ?
Chewie , just do it .
All right , all right !
Alert my Stardestroyer to prepare for my arrival .
Look , someone 's up there .
It 's Luke . Chewie , slow down .
We 'll get under him . Lando , open the top hatch .
Okay . Easy , Chewie .
Lando ? Okay , let 's go .
All right , Chewie . Let 's go .
I 'll be back .
Stardestroyer .
All right , Chewie . Ready for light speed .
If your people fixed the hyperdrive .
All the coordinates are set . It 's now or never .
Punch it !
They told me they fixed it .
I trusted them !
It 's not my fault !
They 'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments , lord .
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon ?
Yes , my lord . Good .
Prepare the boarding party and set your weapons for stun . Yes , my lord . Lieutenant . Yes , sir .
Noisy brute . Why do n't we just go into light speed ?
We ca n't ? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated ?
The city 's central computer told you ?
R2 - D2 , you know better than to trust a strange computer .
Ouch ! Pay attention to what you 're doing .
Father .
Son , come with me .
Ben . Why did n't you tell me ?
It 's Vader .
Luke , it is your destiny .
Why did n't you tell me ?
Alert all commands . Ready for the tractor beam .
R2 , come back at once ! You have n't finished with me yet .
You do n't know how to fix the hyperdrive . Chewbacca can do it .
I 'm standing here in pieces and you 're having delusions of grandeur !
You did it !
Luke , we 're ready for take - off . Good luck , Lando .
When we find Jabba the Hutt and that bounty hunter , we 'll contact you .
I 'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine .
Princess , we 'll find Han . I promise .
Chewie , I 'll be waiting for your signal .
Take care , you two .
May the Force be with you .
Command station , this is ST - 321 . Code clearance blue .
We 're starting our approach . Deactivate the security shield .
The security deflector shield will be deactivated ...
when we have confirmation of your code transmission .
Stand by .
You are clear to proceed .
We 're starting our approach .
Inform the commander that Lord Vader 's shuttle has arrived .
Sir .
Lord Vader , this is an unexpected pleasure . We 're honoured .
You may dispense with the pleasantries , Commander .
I 'm here to put you back on schedule .
I assure you , Lord Vader , my men are working as fast as they can .
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them .
I tell you this station will be operational as planned .
The emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation .
But he asks the impossible . I need more men .
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives .
The emperor 's coming here ? That is correct , Commander ...
and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress .
We shall double our efforts .
I hope so , Commander , for your sake .
The emperor is not as forgiving as I am .
Of course I 'm worried . And you should be too .
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place .
Do n't be so sure .
If I told you half the things I 've heard about this Jabba the Hutt ...
you 'd probably short - circuit .
R2 , are you sure this is the right place ?
I 'd better knock , I suppose .
There does n't seem to be anyone here . Let 's go back and tell Master Luke .
Goodness gracious me !
I do n't think they 're going to let us in , R2 .
We 'd better go .
R2 , wait .
Oh , dear . R2 .
R2 , I really do n't think we should rush into all this .
Oh , R2 !
R2 , wait for me !
Just you deliver Master Luke 's message and get us out of here .
Oh , my !
Oh , no .
Oh , my .
We bring a message to your master , Jabba the Hutt .
And a gift .
What gift ?
He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself .
I 'm terribly sorry . I 'm afraid he 's ever so stubborn about these sort of things .
R2 , I have a bad feeling about this .
Good morning .
The message , R2 . The message .
Greetings , Exalted One .
Allow me to introduce myself .
I am Luke Skywalker , Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo .
I know that you are powerful , mighty Jabba ...
and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful .
I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo 's life .
With your wisdom , I 'm sure we can work out an arrangement ...
which will be mutually beneficial ...
and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation .
As a token of my goodwill , I present to you a gift -
What did he say ?
Both are hard - working and will serve you well .
This ca n't be . R2 , you 're playing the wrong message .
He 's no Jedi .
There will be no bargain .
We 're doomed .
I will not give up my favourite decoration .
I like Captain Solo where he is . R2 , look . Captain Solo .
And he 's still frozen in carbonite .
What could possibly have come over Master Luke ?
Was it something I did ? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work .
How horrid !
Good . New acquisitions .
You are a protocol droid , are you not ?
I am C - 3PO -
Yes or no will do .
Well , yes .
How many languages do you speak ?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can readily -
Splendid . We have been without an interpreter ...
since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him .
Disintegrated ?
Guard , this protocol droid might be useful .
Fit him with a restraining bolt ...
and take him back up to His Excellency 's main audience chamber .
R2 , do n't leave me !
You 're a feisty little one ...
but you 'll soon learn some respect .
I have need for you on the master 's sail barge ...
and I think you 'll fill in nicely .
Ah ! Do that again !
I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee .
Oh , no . Chewbacca .
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca .
Yes , I am here , Your Worshipfulness .
Yes ?
The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of 25 , 000 .
I want 50 , 000 . No less .
" 50 , 000 . No less . "
What did I say ?
The mighty Jabba asks why he must pay 50 , 000 .
Because he 's holding a thermal detonator .
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum ...
fearless and inventive .
Jabba offers the sum of 35 ...
and I do suggest you take it .
He agrees !
Just relax for a moment .
You 're free of the carbonite .
You have hibernation sickness .
I ca n't see . Your eyesight will return in time .
Where am I ? Jabba 's palace .
Who are you ?
Someone who loves you . Leia .
I gotta get you out of here .
What 's that ?
I know that laugh .
Hey , Jabba .
Look , Jabba , I was just on my way to pay you back .
I got a little sidetracked . It 's not my fault .
It 's too late for that , Solo .
You may have been a good smuggler ...
but now you 're Bantha fodder .
Look -
Take him away .
Jabba , I 'll pay you triple .
You 're throwing away a fortune here . Do n't be a fool .
Bring her to me .
We have powerful friends .
You 're gonna regret this .
I 'm sure .
I ca n't bear to watch .
Chewie ?
Chewie , is that you ?
Wait a minute . I ca n't see , pal .
What 's going on ?
Luke ? Luke 's crazy .
He ca n't even take care of himself , much less rescue anybody .
AJedi knight ?
I 'm out of it for a little while , everybody gets delusions of grandeur .
I 'm all right , pal .
I 'm all right .
I must speak with Jabba .
No bargain .
You will take me to Jabba now .
You serve your master well .
And you will be rewarded .
At last ! Master Luke 's come to rescue me .
Master .
Luke Skywalker , Jedi knight .
I told you not to admit him .
I must be allowed to speak .
He must be allowed to speak .
You weak - minded fool !
He 's using an old Jedi mind trick .
You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me .
Your mind powers will not work on me , boy .
Nevertheless ...
I 'm taking Captain Solo and his friends .
You can either profit by this or be destroyed .
It 's your choice , but I warn you not to underestimate my powers .
Master Luke , you 're standing on -
There will be no bargain , young Jedi .
I shall enjoy watching you die .
Oh , no ! The rancor !
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee .
They will all suffer for this outrage .
Han .
Are you all right ? Fine . Together again , huh ?
Would n't miss it . How are we doin ' ?
Same as always . That bad , huh ?
Where 's Leia ? I 'm here .
Oh , dear .
His High Exaltedness , the great Jabba the Hutt ...
has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately .
Good . I hate long waits .
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea ...
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon ...
nesting place of the all - powerful Sarlacc .
Does n't sound so bad .
In his belly , you will find a new definition of pain and suffering ...
as you are slowly digested over 1 , 000 years .
On second thought , let 's pass on that .
You should have bargained , Jabba .
That 's the last mistake you 'll ever make .
I think my eyes are getting better .
Instead of a big dark blur , I see a big light blur .
There 's nothing to see . I used to live here , you know .
You 're gonna die here , you know . Convenient .
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando .
I 've taken care of everything .
Great .
Soon you will learn to appreciate me .
I 'm terribly sorry .
R2 , what are you doing here ?
I can see you 're serving drinks , but this place is dangerous .
They 're going to execute Master Luke , and if we 're not careful , us too .
I wish I had your confidence .
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc ...
His Excellency hopes that you will die honourably .
But should any of you wish to beg for mercy ...
the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas .
3PO , you tell that slimy piece of worm - ridden filth ...
he 'll get no such pleasure from us !
Right ?
This is your last chance .
Free us or die .
Move him into position .
Put him in .
Easy , Chewie .
Help !
Chewie , you 're hit ? Where is it ?
Han , Chewie !
Lando .
Boba Fett ? Boba Fett ? Where ?
Lando , grab it ! Lower it !
I 'm trying !
Grab me , Chewie . Grab it !
Grab it . Almost . You almost got it .
Gently , now .
Easy . Hold me , Chewie .
Chewie , give me the gun .
Do n't move , Lando . Wait ! I thought you were blind !
I can see a lot better . Do n't move .
A little higher !
Chewie , pull us up .
Up , Chewie . Up .
We gotta get out of here .
Not my eyes ! R2 , help !
Quickly , R2 !
Beast ! Get the gun !
Point it at the deck .
Point it at the deck !
R2 , where are we going ? I could n't possibly -
Come on .
Let 's go . Do n't forget the droids . We 're on our way .
I 'll meet you back at the fleet .
Hurry . The Alliance should be assembled by now .
I will . Luke , thanks .
Thanks for coming after me . Now I owe you one .
That 's right , R2 . We 're going to the Dagobah system .
I have a promise to keep ...
to an old friend .
Rise , my friend .
The Death Star will be completed on schedule .
You 've done well , Lord Vader .
Now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker .
Yes , my master .
Patience , my friend .
In time , he will seek you out .
When he does , you must bring him before me .
He has grown strong .
Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force .
As you wish .
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen .
That face you make -
Look I so old to young eyes ?
No , of course not .
I do .
Yes , I do .
Sick have I become .
Old and weak .
When 900 years old you reach ...
look as good you will not .
Soon will I rest . Yes . Forever sleep .
Earned it I have .
Master Yoda , you ca n't die .
Strong am I with the Force ...
but not that strong .
Twilight is upon me , and soon night must fall .
That is the way of things ...
the way of the Force .
But I need your help .
I 've come back to complete the training .
No more training do you require .
Already know you that which you need .
Then I am a Jedi .
Not yet .
One thing remains -
Vader . You must confront Vader .
Then - only then - a Jedi will you be .
And confront him you will .
Master Yoda ...
is Darth Vader my father ?
Rest I need .
Yes . Rest .
Yoda , I must know .
Your father he is .
Told you , did he ?
Yes .
Unexpected this is .
And unfortunate .
Unfortunate that I know the truth ?
No .
Unfortunate that you rushed to face him ...
that incomplete was your training ...
that not ready for the burden were you .
I 'm sorry .
Remember , a Jedi 's strength flows from the Force .
But beware .
Anger , fear , aggression ...
the dark side are they .
Once you start down the dark path ...
forever will it dominate your destiny .
Do not -
Do not underestimate the powers of the emperor ...
or suffer your father 's fate you will .
When gone am I ...
the last of the Jedi will you be .
The Force runs strong in your family .
Pass on what you have learned .
There is another ...
Skywalker .
I ca n't do it , R2 .
I ca n't go on alone .
Yoda will always be with you .
Obi - Wan .
Why did n't you tell me ?
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father .
Your father was seduced by the dark side of the Force .
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader .
When that happened ...
the good man who was your father was destroyed .
So what I told you was true ...
from a certain point of view .
A certain point of view ?
Luke , you 're going to find that many of the truths we cling to ...
depend greatly on our own point of view .
Anakin was a good friend .
When I first knew him ...
your father was already a great pilot ...
but I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him .
I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi .
I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda .
I was wrong .
There is still good in him .
He 's more machine now than man ...
twisted and evil .
I ca n't do it , Ben .
You cannot escape your destiny .
You must face Darth Vader again .
I ca n't kill my own father .
Then the emperor has already won .
You were our only hope .
Yoda spoke of another .
The other he spoke of is your twin sister .
But I have no sister .
To protect you both from the emperor ...
you were hidden from your father when you were born .
The emperor knew , as I did ...
if Anakin were to have any offspring ...
they would be a threat to him .
That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous .
Leia is my sister . Your insight serves you well .
Bury your feelings deep down , Luke .
They do you credit ...
but they could be made to serve the emperor .
Look at you . A general , huh ?
Someone must have told them about my manoeuvre at the Battle of Tanaab .
Do n't look at me , pal . I just said you were a fair pilot .
I did n't know they were looking for somebody to lead this crazy attack .
I 'm surprised they did n't ask you to do it .
Who says they did n't ? But I ai n't crazy .
You 're the respectable one , remember ?
The emperor 's made a critical error and the time for our attack has come .
The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoint the exact location ...
of the emperor 's new battle station .
We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational .
With the imperial fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us ...
it is relatively unprotected .
But most important of all ...
we 've learned that the emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages ...
of the construction of this Death Star .
Many Bothans died to bring us this information .
Admiral Ackbar , please .
You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest moon of Endor .
Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational ...
the Death Star does have a strong defence mechanism .
It is protected by an energy shield ...
which is generated from the nearby forest moon of Endor .
The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted .
Once the shield is down , our cruisers will create a perimeter ...
while the fighters fly into the superstructure ...
and attempt to knock out the main reactor .
General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack . Good luck .
You 're gonna need it .
General Madine .
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle .
Disguised as a cargo ship and using a secret imperial code ...
a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator .
Sounds dangerous .
Wonder who they found to pull that off .
General Solo , is your strike team assembled ?
My team 's ready . I do n't have a command crew for the shuttle .
It 's gonna be rough . I did n't wanna speak for you .
That 's one . General , count me in .
I 'm with you too .
What is it ? Ask me again sometime .
Hi , Han , Chewie .
" Exciting " is hardly the word I would choose .
Look , I want you to take her .
I mean it . Take her .
You need all the help you can get . She 's the fastest ship in the fleet .
All right , old buddy . I know what she means to you .
I 'll take good care of her . She wo n't get a scratch .
Right .
I got your promise . Not a scratch .
Would you get going , you pirate ?
Good luck .
You too .
Got her warmed ? Yeah , she 's coming up .
I do n't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her , Chewie .
Hey , you awake ?
Yeah . I just got a funny feeling , like I 'm not gonna see her again .
Come on , General . Let 's move .
Right . Chewie , let 's see what this piece of junk can do .
Ready , everybody ? All set .
Here we go again .
All right , hang on .
What is thy bidding , my master ?
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor .
There it will stay until called for .
What of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near Sullust ?
It is of no concern .
Soon the rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us .
Your work here is finished , my friend .
Go out to the command ship and await my orders .
Yes , my master .
If they do n't go for this , we 're gonna have to get out pretty quick .
We have you on our screen now . Please identify .
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield .
Shuttle Tydirium , transmit the clearance code for shield passage .
Transmission commencing .
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid .
It 'll work . It 'll work .
Vader 's on that ship .
Do n't get jittery , Luke .
There are a lot of command ships .
Keep your distance , Chewie , but do n't look like you 're keeping your distance .
I do n't know . Fly casual .
Where is that shuttle going ?
Shuttle Tydirium , what is your cargo and destination ?
Parts and technical crew for the forest moon .
Do they have a code clearance ?
It 's an older code , sir , but it checks out .
I was about to clear them .
I 'm endangering the mission . I should n't have come .
It 's your imagination , kid .
Come on . Let 's keep a little optimism here .
Shall I hold them ?
No . Leave them to me . I will deal with them myself .
As you wish , my lord . Carry on .
They 're not going for it , Chewie .
Shuttle Tydirium ...
deactivation of the shield will commence immediately . Follow your present course .
Okay . I told you it was gonna work . No problem .
I told you it was dangerous here .
Should we try and go around ? It 'll take time .
This whole party will be for nothing if they see us .
Chewie and I will take care of this . You stay here .
Quietly . There might be more of them out there .
Hey it 's me .
Go for help ! Go !
Great . Come on !
Over there ! Two more of them .
I see them . Wait . Leia !
Hey , wait !
Quick , jam their comlink . Centre switch .
Move closer .
Get alongside that one .
Keep on that one . I 'll take these two .
General Solo , somebody 's coming .
Where 's Leia ?
She did n't come back ? I thought she was with you .
We got separated . We better go look for her .
Take the squad ahead . We 'll meet at the shield generator at 0300 .
Come on , R2 . We 'll need your scanners .
Do n't worry , Master Luke . We know what to do .
And you said it was pretty here .
Cut it out .
I 'm not gonna hurt you .
Well , looks like I 'm stuck here .
Trouble is , I do n't know where here is .
Maybe you can help me .
Come on . Sit down .
I promise I wo n't hurt you . Now come here .
All right . You want something to eat ?
That 's right .
Come on .
Look . It 's a hat .
It 's not gonna hurt you . Look .
You 're a jittery little thing , are n't you ?
What is it ?
Freeze !
Come on . Get up .
Get your ride . Take her back to base . Yes , sir .
What the -
Come on . Let 's get out of here .
I told you to remain on the command ship .
A small rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor .
Yes , I know .
My son is with them .
Are you sure ? I have felt him , my master .
Strange that I have not .
I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear , Lord Vader .
They are clear , my master .
Then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for him .
He will come to me ?
I have foreseen it .
His compassion for you will be his undoing .
He will come to you , and then you will bring him before me .
As you wish .
Master Luke .
There 's two more wrecked speeders back there .
And I found this .
I 'm afraid that R2 's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia .
I hope she 's all right .
What , Chewie ?
What , Chewie ?
I do n't get it . It 's just a dead animal .
Chewie , wait ! Do n't !
Nice work .
Great , Chewie . Great . Always thinking with your stomach .
Take it easy . Let 's just figure a way to get out of this thing .
Han , can you reach my lightsabre ? Yeah . Sure .
R2 , I 'm not sure that 's such a good idea .
It 's a very long drop !
Hey . Point that thing someplace else .
Han , do n't . It 'll be all right .
Chewie , give them your crossbow .
Oh , my head .
Oh , my goodness .
Do you understand anything they 're saying ?
Oh , yes , Master Luke .
Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms -
What are you telling them ?
" Hello , " I think .
I could be mistaken - they 're using a very primitive dialect -
but I do believe they think I am some sort of god .
Why do n't you use your divine influence and get us out of this ?
I beg your pardon , General Solo , but that just would n't be proper .
Proper ?
It 's against my programming to impersonate a deity .
Why , you -
My mistake .
He 's an old friend of mine .
I have a really bad feeling about this .
What did he say ?
I 'm rather embarrassed , General Solo ...
but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honour .
Your Royal Highness .
These are my friends .
3PO , tell them they must be set free .
Somehow I got the feeling that did n't help us very much .
3PO , tell them if they do n't do as you wish ...
you 'll become angry and use your magic .
But , Master Luke , what magic ? I could n't possibly -
Tell them .
You see , Master Luke ? They did n't believe me ...
just as I said they would n't .
What 's happening ?
Put me down ! Help !
Somebody ! Somebody help !
Master Luke ! R2 , quickly !
Thank goodness .
Thanks , 3PO .
I never knew I had it in me .
... Tatooine ...
Princess Leia ... R2 .
... Darth Vader !
... Death Star .
... Jedi ... Obi - Wan Kenobi .
Yes , R2 , I was just coming to that .
Master Luke ...
... Millennium Falcon ... Cloud City .
... Vader !
Han Solo ...
... carbon .
... Sarlacc .
What 's going on ? I do n't know .
Wonderful . We are now a part of the tribe .
Just what I always wanted .
Short help 's better than no help at all , Chewie .
The scouts will show us the quickest way to the shield generator .
Good . How far is it ?
Ask him .
We need some fresh supplies too .
Try and get our weapons back .
Hurry up . I have n't got all day .
Luke , what 's wrong ?
Leia , do you remember your mother - / your real mother ?
Just a little bit . She died when I was very young .
What do you remember ?
Just images really . Feelings .
Tell me .
She was ... very beautiful .
Kind ... but sad .
Why are you asking me this ?
I have no memory of my mother .
I never knew her .
Luke , tell me . What 's troubling you ?
Vader is here . Now . On this moon .
How do you know ?
I felt his presence .
He 's come for me . He can feel when I 'm near .
That 's why I have to go .
As long as I stay , I 'm endangering the group and our mission here .
I have to face him . Why ?
He 's my father .
Your father ?
There 's more . It wo n't be easy for you to hear it , but you must .
If I do n't make it back , you 're the only hope for the Alliance .
Do n't talk that way .
You have a power I do n't understand and could never have .
You 're wrong , Leia .
You have that power too .
In time , you 'll learn to use it as I have .
The Force is strong in my family .
My father has it .
I have it .
And my sister has it .
Yes . It 's you , Leia .
I know .
Somehow ...
I 've always known .
Then you know why I have to face him .
Luke , run away . Far away .
If he can feel your presence , then leave this place .
I wish I could go with you . No , you do n't .
But why must you confront him ?
Because there is good in him . I 've felt it .
He wo n't turn me over to the emperor .
I can save him . I can turn him back to the good side .
I have to try .
Hey , what 's going on ?
Nothing . I just wanna be alone for a little while .
Nothing ?
Tell me . What 's going on ?
I ca n't tell you .
Could you tell Luke ? Is that who you could tell ?
I 'm sorry .
Hold me .
This is the rebel that surrendered to us .
Although he denies it , I believe there may be more of them ...
and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area .
He was armed only with this .
Good work , Commander .
Leave us . Conduct your search and bring his companions to me .
Yes , my lord .
The emperor has been expecting you .
I know , Father .
So , you have accepted the truth .
I 've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker , my father .
That name no longer has any meaning for me .
It is the name of your true self . You 've only forgotten .
I know there is good in you .
The emperor has n't driven it from you fully .
That was why you could n't destroy me .
That 's why you wo n't bring me to your emperor now .
I see you have constructed a new lightsabre .
Your skills are complete .
Indeed you are powerful , as the emperor has foreseen .
Come with me .
Obi - Wan once thought as you do .
You do n't know the power of the dark side .
I must obey my master .
I will not turn , and you 'll be forced to kill me .
If that is your destiny .
Search your feelings , Father . You ca n't do this .
I feel the conflict within you . Let go of your hate .
It is too late for me , son .
The emperor will show you the true nature of the Force .
He is your master now .
Then my father is truly dead .
The main entrance to the control bunker is on the far side of that landing platform .
This is n't gonna be easy . Do n't worry .
Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this .
What 's he saying ?
He says there 's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge .
Admiral , we 're in position . All fighters accounted for .
Proceed with the countdown .
All groups assume attack coordinates .
Do n't worry . My friend 's down there .
He 'll have that shield down on time .
Or this 'll be the shortest offensive of all time .
All craft , prepare to jump into hyperspace on my mark .
All right . Stand by .
Back door , huh ? Good idea .
It 's only a few guards . This should n't be too much trouble .
It only takes one to sound the alarm .
Then we 'll do it real quiet - like .
Oh , my . Princess Leia . Quiet .
I 'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash .
There goes our surprise attack .
Look , over there ! Stop him !
Not bad for a little furball . There 's only one left .
You stay here . We 'll take care of this .
I have decided that we shall stay here .
Welcome , young Skywalker .
I have been expecting you .
You 'll no longer need those .
Guards , leave us .
I 'm looking forward to completing your training .
In time , you will call me master .
You 're gravely mistaken .
You wo n't convert me as you did my father .
Oh , no , my young Jedi .
You will find that it is you who are mistaken ...
about a great many things .
His lightsabre .
Ah , yes . A Jedi 's weapon .
Much like your father 's .
By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side .
So will it be with you .
You 're wrong . Soon I 'll be dead - and you with me .
Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your rebel fleet .
Yes .
I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here .
Your overconfidence is your weakness .
Your faith in your friends is yours .
It is pointless to resist , my son .
Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design .
Your friends up there on the sanctuary moon are walking into a trap , as is your rebel fleet .
It was I who allowed the Alliance ...
to know the location of the shield generator .
It is quite safe from your pitiful little band .
An entire legion of my best troops awaits them .
I 'm afraid the deflector shield ...
will be quite operational when your friends arrive .
All right ! Up ! Move !
Quickly . Quickly .
Han , hurry . The fleet will be here any moment .
Charges . Come on . Come on !
Oh , my . They 'll be captured .
Wait ! Come back !
R2 , stay with me .
Freeze !
You rebel scum .
All wings report in . Red Leader standing by .
Grey Leader standing by . Green Leader standing by .
Lock S - foils in attack positions .
May the Force be with us .
We 've gotta be able to get a reading on that shield - up or down .
How could they be jamming us if they do n't know -
if we 're coming .
Break off the attack . The shield is still up .
I get no reading . You sure ?
Pull up ! All craft pull up !
Take evasive action . Green Group , stick close to Holding Sector MV - 7 .
Admiral , we have enemy ships in Sector 47 .
It 's a trap .
Fighters coming in .
There 's too many .
Accelerate to attack speed . Draw their fire away from the cruisers .
Copy , Gold Leader .
Come , boy . See for yourself .
From here , you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance ...
and the end of your insignificant rebellion .
You want this do n't you ?
The hate is swelling in you now .
Take your Jedi weapon . Use it .
I am unarmed .
Strike me down with it .
Give in to your anger .
With each passing moment you make yourself more my servant .
It is unavoidable .
It is your destiny .
You , like your father ...
are now mine .
All right , move it .
Hello . I say , over there .
Were you looking for me ?
Bring those two down here .
They 're on their way . R2 , are you sure this was a good idea ?
Freeze .
Do n't move .
We surrender .
The code 's changed .
We need R2 . Here 's the terminal .
R2 , where are you ?
We need you at the bunker right away .
Going ? What do you mean ?
Going where , R2 ?
Wait . R2 , this is no time for heroics .
Come back !
Watch yourself , Wedge . Three from above .
Red Three , Red Two , pull in . Got it .
Three of them coming in , 20 degrees .
Cut left . I 'll take the leader .
They 're heading for the medical frigate .
Pressure 's steady .
Only the fighters are attacking . What are the Stardestroyers waiting for ?
We 're in attack position , sir .
Hold here . We 're not going to attack ?
My orders are from the emperor himself . He has something special planned .
We only need to keep them from escaping .
As you can see , my young apprentice ...
your friends have failed .
Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station .
Fire at will , Commander .
Fire .
That blast came from the Death Star .
That thing 's operational .
Home 1 , this is Gold Leader .
We saw it . All craft prepare to retreat .
You wo n't get another chance at this , Admiral .
We have no choice , General Calrissian .
Our cruisers ca n't repel firepower of that magnitude .
Han will have that shield down . We 've gotta give him more time .
We 're coming .
Come on .
R2 , hurry !
My goodness !
Why did you have to be so brave ?
Well , I suppose I could hot - wire this thing . I 'll cover you .
Yes , I said closer . Move as close as you can ...
and engage those Stardestroyers at point - blank range .
At that close range , we wo n't last long against those Stardestroyers .
We 'll last longer than we will against that Death Star ...
and we might take a few of them with us .
She 's gonna blow !
I 'm hit !
Your fleet is lost ...
and your friends on the Endor moon will not survive .
There is no escape my young apprentice .
The Alliance will die ...
as will your friends .
Good .
I can feel your anger .
I am defenceless . Take your weapon .
Strike me down with all of your hatred ...
and your journey towards the dark side will be complete .
Look ! Get him off of there .
I think I got it .
I got it !
Are you all right ?
Let 's see . It 's not bad .
Freeze ! Oh , dear .
Do n't move .
I love you . I know .
Hands up .
Stand up .
Stay back .
Get down here . She 's wounded .
No , wait .
I got an idea .
Good .
Use your aggressive feelings , boy .
Let the hate flow through you .
Obi - Wan has taught you well .
I will not fight you , Father .
You are unwise to lower your defences .
Your thoughts betray you , Father .
I feel the good in you , the conflict .
There is no conflict .
You could n't bring yourself to kill me before ...
and I do n't believe you 'll destroy me now .
You underestimate the power of the dark side .
If you will not fight then you will meet your destiny .
Good . Good .
Watch out . Squad at . 06 . I 'm on it , Gold Leader .
Good shot , Red Two .
We 're sure in the middle of it now . Come on , Han , old buddy .
It 's over , Commander . The rebels have been routed . They 're fleeing .
We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit . Send three squads to help .
Open the back door . Sir .
Throw me another charge .
You cannot hide forever , Luke .
I will not fight you .
Give yourself to the dark side .
It is the only way you can save your friends .
Yes . Your thoughts betray you .
Your feelings for them are strong ...
especially for ...
sister .
So you have a twin sister .
Your feelings have now betrayed her too .
Obi - Wan was wise to hide her from me .
Now his failure is complete .
If you will not turn to the dark side ...
then perhaps she will .
Never !
Good !
Your hate has made you powerful .
Now , fulfil your destiny ...
and take your father 's place at my side .
Never .
I 'll never turn to the dark side .
You 've failed , Your Highness .
I am a Jedi ...
like my father before me .
So be it , Jedi .
Move ! Move !
The shield is down . Commence attack on the Death Star 's main reactor .
We 're on our way . Red Group , Gold Group , all fighters follow me .
I told you they 'd do it .
If you will not be turned ...
you will be destroyed .
Young fool .
Only now , at the end do you understand .
Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side .
You have paid the price for your lack of vision .
Father , please !
Now , young Skywalker ...
you will die .
I 'm going in .
Here goes nothing .
Lock onto the strongest power source . It should be the power generator .
Form up . Stay alert . We could run out of space real fast .
Split up and head back to the surface .
See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you .
Copy , Gold Leader .
That was too close .
We 've got to give those fighters more time .
Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer .
Sir , we 've lost our bridge deflector shields .
Intensify the forward batteries . I do n't want anything to get through .
Intensify forward firepower !
Too late !
Help me take this mask off .
But you 'll die .
Nothing can stop that now .
Just for once ...
let me look on you with my own eyes .
Now go , my son .
Leave me .
No . You 're coming with me .
I 'll not leave you here . I 've got to save you .
You already have , Luke .
You were right .
You were right about me .
Tell your sister ...
you were right .
Father .
I wo n't leave you .
There it is .
Wedge , go for the power regulator on the north tower .
Copy , Gold Leader . I 'm already on my way out .
Move the fleet away from the Death Star .
They did it !
I 'm sure Luke was n't on that thing when it blew .
He was n't . I can feel it .
You love him .
Do n't you ?
Yes .
All right . I understand .
When he comes back I wo n't get in the way .
It 's not like that at all .
He 's my brother .
Wesa free !
