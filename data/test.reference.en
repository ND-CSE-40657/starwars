Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise ?
I thought not . It 's not a story the Jedi would tell you .
It 's a Sith legend .
Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith ...
so powerful and so wise ...
he could use the Force to influence the midi - chlorians ...
He had such a knowledge of the dark side ...
he could even keep the ones he cared about ...
from dying .
He could actually ... save people from death ?
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities ...
some consider to be unnatural .
What happened to him ? He became so powerful ...
the only thing he was afraid of was ...
Iosing his power . Which eventually , of course , he did .
Unfortunately , he taught his apprentice everything he knew .
Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep .
It 's ironic .
He could save others from death but not himself .
Is it possible to learn this power ?
Not from a Jedi .
All Red units , over here !
Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau ?
A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the chairman of Utapau .
Act on this we must .
The capture of General Grievous will end this war . Quickly and decisively we should proceed .
The chancellor has requested ... that I lead the campaign .
The council will make up its own mind who is to go not the chancellor .
A master is needed , with more experience .
I concur . Master Kenobi should go .
I agree . Aye .
Aye . Very well . Council adjourned .
The droids have started up their main power generators .
Then now the time is , Commander . Yes , sir .
Head for cover !
You 're gonna need me on this one . I agree .
However , it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase .
I 've disappointed you . I have n't been very appreciative of your training .
I 've been arrogant , and I apologize .
You are strong and wise , Anakin , and I am very proud of you .
I have trained you since you were a small boy . I have taught you everything I know .
And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be .
But be patient , Anakin . It will not be long before the council makes you a Jedi master .
Obi - Wan . May the Force be with you .
Fortunately , most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here .
On the far side . I 'll keep them distracted until you get there .
Just do n't take too long . Come on . When have I ever let you down ?
Very well . The burden is on me not to destroy all the droids until you arrive .
Save your energy .
I ca n't .
Obi - Wan 's been here , has n't he ?
What did he want ?
He says you 've been under a lot of stress .
I feel lost . Lost ? What do you mean ?
Obi - Wan and the council do n't trust me .
Something 's happening .
I want more .
You expect too much of yourself .
I found a way to save you . Save me ?
From my nightmares . Is that what 's bothering you ?
I wo n't lose you , Padmé .
I 'm not gonna die in childbirth , Ani . I promise you . No , I promise you .
Greetings , young Jedi .
What brings you to our remote sanctuary ? Unfortunately , the war .
There 's no war here - unless you brought it with you .
With your kind permission , I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous .
He is here . We are being held hostage .
They are watching us . I understand .
Tenth level , thousands of battle droids .
Tell your people to take shelter . If you have warriors , now is the time .
Take the fighter back to the ship . Tell Cody I 've made contact .
Is he bringing additional warriors ? He did n't say .
It wo n't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here .
I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the outer rim .
It is a volcanic planet .
You will be safe there . Safe ?
Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip , General . Without Count Dooku , I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe .
Be thankful , Viceroy , you have not found yourself in my grip .
Your ship is waiting .
General Kenobi .
Back away .
I will deal with this Jedi slime myself . Your move .
You fool . I 've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku .
Attack , Kenobi .
Army or not ...
you must realize you are doomed . I do n't think so .
Master Windu , may I interrupt ?
and we have begun our attack .
Thank you , Commander . Anakin , deliver this report to the chancellor .
His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions .
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi .
The dark side of the Force surrounds the chancellor . If he does not give up his emergency powers ...
after the destruction of Grievous ...
The Jedi Council would have to take control of the senate ...
in order to secure a peaceful transition . To a dark place this line of thought will carry us .
Great care we must take .
Chancellor . We 've just received a report from Master Kenobi .
He has engaged General Grievous .
I should be there with him . It 's upsetting to me to see that the council ...
does n't seem to fully appreciate your talents . Do n't you wonder why they wo n't make you a Jedi master ?
I wish I knew . More and more I get the feeling that ...
I know there are things about the Force that they 're not telling me .
They do n't trust you , Anakin . They see your future .
They know your power will be too strong to control .
You must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you .
Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force .
How do you know the ways of the Force ? My mentor taught me everything about the Force .
Even the nature of the dark side .
You know the dark side ?
If one is to understand the great mystery ...
one must study all its aspects not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi .
If you wish to become a complete and wise leader ...
you must embrace a larger view of the Force . Be careful of the Jedi , Anakin .
Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi .
Learn to know the dark side of the Force and you will be able to save your wife ...
from certain death .
What did you say ? Use my knowledge . I beg you .
You 're the Sith lord . I know what 's been troubling you . Listen to me .
Do n't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council .
Ever since I 've known you , you 've been searching for a life ...
greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . A life of significance ...
Are you going to kill me ? I would certainly like to .
I know you would . I can feel your anger .
It gives you focus ...
I 'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council .
But you 're not sure of their intentions , are you ? I will quickly discover the truth of all this .
You have great wisdom , Anakin .
Know the power of the dark side . Power to save Padmé .
So uncivilized .
Master Windu , I must talk to you . Skywalker , we just received word that Obi - Wan has destroyed General Grievous .
We 're on our way to make sure ...
the chancellor returns emergency power back to the senate . He wo n't give up his power . I 've just learned a terrible truth .
I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord .
A Sith lord ? Yes . The one we 've been looking for .
How do you know this ? He knows the ways of the Force . He 's been trained to use the dark side .
Are you sure ? Absolutely .
Then our worst fears have been realized . We must move quickly if the Jedi order is to survive .
Master , the chancellor is very powerful .
You 'll need my help if you 're going to arrest him . For you own good , stay out of this affair .
I sense a great deal of confusion in you , young Skywalker .
There is much fear that clouds your judgement .
I must go , Master . No .
If what you 've told me is true , you will have gained my trust .
But for now , remain here . Wait in the council chambers until we return .
You do know , do n't you ...
if theJedi destroy me any chance of saving her will be lost .
Master Windu . I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then .
I must say you 're here sooner than expected . In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic ...
you 're under arrest , Chancellor .
Are you threatening me , Master Jedi ?
The senate will decide your fate .
I am the senate . Not yet .
It 's treason then .
You are under arrest , my lord .
Anakin , I told you it would come to this . I was right .
The Jedi are taking over .
The oppression of the Sith will never return .
You have lost .
He 's a traitor !
I have the power to save the one you love .
You must choose . Do n't listen to him , Anakin !
Do n't let him kill me .
I ca n't hold it any longer . I ca n't . I 'm weak .
I 'm too weak .
Help me . Help me !
I ca n't hold on any longer . I am going to end this once and for all .
You ca n't .
He must stand trial . He has control of the senate and the courts .
He 's too dangerous to be left alive .
I 'm too weak .
Do n't kill me . Please . It 's not the Jedi way .
Please do n't . I need him .
Please do n't !
Unlimited power !
You 're fulfilling your destiny , Anakin .
Become my apprentice . Learn to use the dark side of the Force .
I will do whatever you ask .
Good . Just help me save Padmé 's life .
I ca n't live without her .
To cheat death is a power only one has achieved but if we work together ...
I know we can discover the secret .
I pledge myself to your teachings .
Good . Good .
The Force is strong with you .
A powerful Sith you will become . Henceforth you shall be known as ...
Darth ... Vader .
Thank you , my master .
Because the council did not trust you , my young apprentice ...
I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot . When the Jedi learn what has transpired here ...
they will kill us , along with all the senators .
I agree . The council 's next move will be against the senate .
Every single Jedi ...
including your friend Obi - Wan Kenobi is now an enemy of the Republic .
I understand , Master . We must move quickly .
The Jedi are relentless .
If they are not all destroyed , it will be civil war without end .
First I want you to go to the Jedi temple .
We will catch them off - balance . Do what must be done , Lord Vader .
Do not hesitate . Show no mercy .
Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side ...
to save Padmé . What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy ?
Their betrayal will be dealt with .
After you have killed all the Jedi in the temple ...
go to the Mustafar system . Wipe out Viceroy Gunray ...
and the other separatist leaders .
Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy !
And ...
we shall have ... peace .
Sergeant , over here !
All Red units , let 's move it !
Commander , contact your troops .
Tell them to move to the higher levels . Very good , sir .
By the way , I think you 'll be needing this . Thank you , Cody . Let 's get a move on . We 've got a battle to win .
Commander Cody the time has come .
Execute order 66 .
Execute order 66 .
Master Skywalker , there are too many of them .
The chancellor 's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple .
What 's going on here ? There 's been a rebellion , sir .
Do n't worry . The situation is under control .
I 'm sorry , sir . It 's time for you to leave . And so it is .
Get him !
All these Wookiees are dead . Move to the east .
Goodbye , Tarfful .
Hopefully we 'll be able to intercept a few Jedi ...
Did you find Kenobi ?
Sir , no one could have survived that fall .
Start loading your men on the ships .
Emergency code 913 .
Master Kenobi .
Repeat . Master Kenobi . Senator Organa . My clone troops turned on me . I need help .
We havejust rescued Master Yoda .
It appears this ambush has happened everywhere .
Hush ! Not so loud .
Are you all right ? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi temple . You could see the smoke from here . I 'm fine .
I came to see if you and the baby are safe .
What 's happening ?
The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic .
I ca n't believe that . I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the chancellor myself .
I will not betray the Republic . My loyalties lie with the chancellor ...
and with the senate and with you .
What about Obi - Wan ? I do n't know .
Many Jedi have been killed .
We can only hope that he 's remained loyal to the chancellor . Anakin , I 'm afraid .
Have faith , my love .
Everything will soon be set right .
The chancellor has given me a very important mission .
The separatists have gathered on the Mustafar system . I 'm going there to end this war . Wait for me until I return .
Things will be different . I promise .
Well , he is under a lot of stress , R2 .
Oh , my lady , is there anything I might do ?
No , thank you , 3PO . I feel so helpless .
How many other Jedi have managed to survive ?
Heard from no one have we . I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi temple .
That 's why I went looking for Yoda .
Have we had any contact from the temple ?
Received a coded retreat message we have . It requests all Jedi to return to the temple .
It says the war is over . Then we must go back .
If there are any stragglers , they will fall into the trap and be killed . Suggest dismantling the coded signal , do you ?
Yes , Master . There is too much at stake .
I agree . And a little more knowledge might light our way .
The plan has gone as you had promised , my lord .
You have done well , Viceroy . When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives ...
he will take care of you .
We 're receiving a message from the chancellor 's office , sir .
Send it through . Yes , sir .
Senator Organa , the supreme chancellor requests your presence ...
at a special session of Congress .
Could be a trap . I do n't think so .
without keeping the senate intact . If a special session of Congress there is ...
easier for us to enter the Jedi temple it will be .
Welcome , Lord Vader . We 've been expecting you .
And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled .
The chancellor 's been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate . The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated .
Not even the younglings survived .
Killed not by clones this Padawan .
Who ?
The attempt on my life ...
has left me scarred and deformed .
But I assure you . My resolve has never been stronger !
In order to ensure the security and continuing stability ...
the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire !
For a safe and secure society .
So this is how liberty dies .
With thunderous applause . The war is over .
Lord Sidious promised us peace . We only want -
I have recalibrated the code , warning all surviving Jedi to stay away . For the clones ...
to discover the recalibration a long time it will take .
Wait . Master .
If into the security recordings you go , only pain will you find .
It ca n't be .
It ca n't be .
You have done well , my new apprentice .
Now , Lord Vader ...
go and bring peace to the Empire .
I ca n't watch any more . Destroy the Sith we must .
Send me to kill the emperor .
I will not kill Anakin . To fight this Lord Sidious , strong enough you are not .
He is like my brother . I cannot do it .
Twisted by the dark side young Skywalker has become .
The boy you trained , gone he is .
Consumed by Darth Vader .
I do not know where the emperor has sent him .
I do n't know where to look . Use your feelings , Obi - Wan , and find him you will .
When was the last time you saw him ?
Yesterday . And do you know where he is now ?
Padmé , I need your help .
He is in grave danger . From the Sith ?
From himself .
Anakin has turned to the dark side .
I have seen a security hologram ... of him ...
killing younglings .
Not Anakin . He could n't .
He was deceived by a lie . We all were .
It appears that the chancellor is behind everything , including the war .
Palpatine is the Sith lord we 've been looking for .
I do n't believe you .
I must find him . You 're going to kill him , are n't you ?
He has become a very great threat . I ca n't .
Milady , let me come with you . There 's no danger .
The fighting 's over . And this is personal . As you wish , milady , but I strongly disagree .
I 'll be all right , Captain . This is something I must do myself .
Besides , 3PO will look after me . Oh , dear .
Do you know ? I think I 'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business .
The separatists have been taken care of , my master .
It is finished then .
You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy .
Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation . All droid units must shut down immediately .
I saw your ship . What are you doing out here ? I was so worried about you .
Obi - Wan told me terrible things .
What things ?
He said you 've turned to the dark side .
That you ... killed younglings . Obi - Wan is trying to turn you against me .
He cares about us .
He knows .
Anakin , all I want is your love .
Love wo n't save you , Padmé .
Only my new powers can do that . At what cost ?
You 're a good person . Do n't do this .
I wo n't lose you the way I lost my mother .
I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of .
And I 'm doing it for you . To protect you .
Come away with me .
Help me raise our child .
Leave everything else behind while we still can .
Do n't you see ? We do n't have to run away any more .
I have brought peace to the Republic .
I am more powerful than the chancellor .
I can overthrow him . And together , you and I can rule the galaxy ...
I do n't believe what I 'm hearing . Obi - Wan was right . You 've changed .
I do n't want to hear any more about Obi - Wan .
The Jedi turned against me . Do n't you turn against me .
I do n't know you any more .
You 're breaking my heart .
You 're going down a path I ca n't follow .
Because of Obi - Wan ? Because of what you 've done .
What you plan to do .
Stop . Stop now . Come back .
You 're with him ! You brought him here to kill me .
Let her go , Anakin .
You turned her against me !
You will not take her from me !
You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind ...
until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy .
I see through the lies of the Jedi .
I do not fear the dark side as you do .
I have brought peace ...
freedom , justice and security to my new empire .
Your new empire ?
Do n't make me kill you . Anakin , my allegiance is to the Republic , to democracy !
If you 're not with me ...
then you 're my enemy . Only a Sith deals in absolutes .
I will do what I must .
I hear a new apprentice you have , Emperor .
Or should I call you Darth Sidious ?
Master Yoda .
Surprised ? Your arrogance blinds you , Master Yoda .
Now you will experience ...
I have waited a long time for this moment ...
At last the Jedi are no more .
At an end your rule is . And not short enough it was .
If so powerful you are ...
why leave ?
You will not stop me .
Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us . Faith in your new apprentice misplaced may be .
As is your faith in the dark side of the Force .
Hurry . Careful timing we will need .
Activate your homing beacon when you 're ready .
There 's no sign of his body , sir .
Then he is not dead . Double your search .
Yes , sir . Right away , sir . Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate take - off .
Yes , Master . I sense Lord Vader is in danger .
Into exile I must go .
I have failed you , Anakin .
I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over .
Anakin , Chancellor Palpatine is evil !
From my point of view , the Jedi are evil .
It 's over , Anakin . I have the high ground .
You underestimate my power .
You were the chosen one !
It was said that you would destroy the Sith , not join them ! Bring balance to the Force , not leave it in darkness !
You were my brother , Anakin .
Master Kenobi . We have Miss Padmé on board . Yes . Please , please hurry .
Your Majesty , this way .
Get a medical capsule immediately .
Medically , she 's completely healthy .
For reasons we ca n't explain , we are losing her .
She 's dying ? We do n't know why .
We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies .
There 's good in him .
I know . I know there 's ... still -
Lord Vader .
Can you hear me ? Yes , Master .
Where is Padmé ?
Is she safe ?
Is she all right ?
It seems , in your anger , you killed her .
I ? I could n't have .
Hidden , safe the children must be kept .
We must take them somewhere where the Sith will not sense their presence . Split up they should be .
My wife and I will take the girl .
We 've always talked of adopting a baby girl .
And what of the boy ?
To Tatooine . To his family send him .
Until the time is right , disappear we will .
Master Kenobi , wait a moment .
In your solitude on Tatooine , training I have for you .
Training ? An old friend has learned the path to immortality .
One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force .
Qui - Gon ? How to commune with him I will teach you .
Captain Antilles . Yes , Your Highness ?
I 'm placing these droids in your care .
Treat them well . Clean them up .
What ?
